<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>SHEPHERD
ROBBINS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Farmer Joyce</span> walked meditatively up
the steep, deeply-rutted lane which led to the field wherein his
sheep were penned.&nbsp; He was a tall, bluff, burly old man,
carrying himself erect in spite of his seventy years, and capable
still of performing a hard day&rsquo;s work with the best of his
juniors.</p>
<p>On one of his broad shoulders rested a pitchfork supporting a
goodly truss of hay; in the other hand he carried a
shepherd&rsquo;s crook.&nbsp; A quaint, picturesque, pastoral
figure was this, clad in the antiquated smock frock, now so
seldom to be seen, but which Farmer Joyce wore summer and winter
alike; his nether limbs were encased in corduroys and stout
leather leggings, and his great nailed boots left impressions,
gigantic and far apart, on the muddy soil.&nbsp; The cutting wind
frolicked with his iron-grey beard and hair, and intensified the
ruddy hue of his broad honest face.&nbsp; The years which had
passed over that kindly face <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>had left wonderfully few traces,
except for the dust with which they had powdered the once
coal-black hair and beard.&nbsp; There were no furrows in the
brow, no pinched lines about the mouth; the eyes looked forth
from under their whitened lashes with the large contemplative
gaze of the man accustomed to pass his life between earth and
sky, to sweep wide horizons, to take note, with one comprehensive
glance, of the changes of the weather, of the coming of the
seasons as indicated by sun and clouds, by bloom or decay
advancing over vast tracts of country.</p>
<p>Farmer Joyce had a mind above petty cares; the small home
worries and anxieties he left, as he frequently announced, his
missus to see to; for himself he kept his soul untroubled, taking
good and evil fortune alike philosophically.&nbsp; Yet to-day his
face wore a puzzled, not to say perturbed, expression, and, as he
neared the top of the hill, he imperceptibly slackened his long,
swinging strides.</p>
<p>At the turn of the road, through the black irregular line of
wintry hedgerow, came glimpses of yellow, standing out vividly
against the sombre background of dull green and grey; these were
the hurdles carefully padded with straw which penned in the
lambing ewes.&nbsp; <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>From the spot where Farmer Joyce stood, pausing a moment
hesitatingly before continuing the ascent, a small tarred
shepherd&rsquo;s hut reared itself between him and the sky, and
presently the figure of a man appeared slowly moving round
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he be,&rdquo; murmured the farmer to himself, and
went on more rapidly.</p>
<p>The figure advanced to meet him, and was standing by the small
wicket gate leading to the field by the time the other reached
it.</p>
<p>An old man, much older, apparently, than his master, the
outlines of his bent shoulders sharply defined under the soiled
linen jacket; his ragged hair and whiskers white, his very face
grey and rugged, ploughed into deep furrows by time and hardship;
the eyes looking straight before them with a dull non-expectant
gaze; the horny old hand, which rested on the gate, gnarled and
knotted, and extraordinarily thin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-day to you, shepherd.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s the
rheumatics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-day, farmer; good-day.&nbsp; Rheumatics is bad,
thank ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Joyce, &ldquo;I fear ye&rsquo;re
falterin&rsquo;, shepherd, I do, truly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shepherd Robbins made no response; he <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>stood aside to
let his master pass into the enclosure.&nbsp; Then the two paced
together from pen to pen, the farmer&rsquo;s usually dreamy eye
alert enough now, and quick to take note of anything amiss.&nbsp;
Once or twice he found fault, and once or twice he gave
directions; Robbins receiving commands and admonitions alike in
stolid silence.&nbsp; With stiff and feeble movements he helped
the farmer to set before the ewes the provender which he had
brought, and stood watching them with him while they precipitated
themselves upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a din they do make&mdash;a body can scarce hear
his own voice,&rdquo; cried Joyce, turning away at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis their natur&rsquo; like, master,&rdquo;
replied the shepherd, hobbling after him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s little need of a-hearin&rsquo; one&rsquo;s
own voice with ewes and lambs about.&nbsp; It do take a man all
his time to see to &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; agreed the farmer, stopping short suddenly
and looking at him, &ldquo;it do, shepherd; it do.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis more nor many a man can do.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis more nor
you can do at your time of life, shepherd, I d&rsquo;
&rsquo;low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do do it,&rdquo; returned Robbins stolidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; pursued the farmer, following out his own
train of thought, as though he had not <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>heard him, &ldquo;we be near
lambin&rsquo; time now, and &rsquo;tis puzzlin&rsquo; to know how
ye&rsquo;re agoin&rsquo; to manage it.&nbsp; It do puzzle me, I
know.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;re falterin&rsquo;, man, I tell
&rsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robbins gazed vacantly at his master, rubbing his gnarled
hands together slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My missus was a-sayin&rsquo; it to me only last
night,&rdquo; pursued the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;She do
think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But here some gleam of intelligence seemed to filter into
Robbins&rsquo; mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Missus do think I&rsquo;m past work,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what she do do.&nbsp; Missus
never could abear me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, come,&rdquo; cried the farmer, with a kind of
mild roar of exasperation.&nbsp; &ldquo;The missus is a good
missus to &rsquo;ee, Robbins.&nbsp; She be but anxious for to
help &rsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s onreasonable,&rdquo; grumbled the shepherd;
&ldquo;onreasonable, that&rsquo;s what she be.&nbsp; She do look
for too much, and expect too much.&nbsp; When Daisy calved she
was vexed at its bein&rsquo; a bull calf.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
missus,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help it if it be a
bull.&nbsp; Things falls out so,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;as we
can&rsquo;t always have our own way.&nbsp; There must be
he&rsquo;s as well as she&rsquo;s in this world.&rsquo;&nbsp;
An&rsquo; she did rate me for the sayin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; she do
keep a grudge agin me ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, now,&rdquo; said Farmer Joyce, sinking <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>his voice, but
still speaking with the air of mild expostulation which had
characterised his former remarks.&nbsp; &ldquo;She don&rsquo;t
bear &rsquo;ee no grudge, man, not she.&nbsp; She be all for
doin&rsquo; &rsquo;ee a good turn, I tell &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; Says
she to me last night, &lsquo;We must gi&rsquo; shepherd
help,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;else he&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er get
through wi&rsquo; the lambin&rsquo; this year.&nbsp; He desarves
consideration,&rsquo; she says.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s worked
for &rsquo;ee faithful all his life.&nbsp; We mus&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
let un drop in &rsquo;arness,&rsquo; says she.&nbsp; Them be her
very words, shepherd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robbins continued to rub his hands, but without any appearance
of gratification.&nbsp; Mr. Joyce coughed, stuck his pitchfork in
the ground, but almost immediately took it out again.&nbsp; He
seemed to find some difficulty in proceeding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them was her very words,&rdquo; he resumed, however,
presently.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;He mus&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be allowed
to drop in &rsquo;arness.&nbsp; We shall be four shillin&rsquo; a
week out o&rsquo; pocket, but Shepherd Robbins do desarve
it,&rsquo; she says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmer paused again.&nbsp; It takes some little time for a
new idea to penetrate into the inner consciousness of a Dorset
rustic, but after a few moments Robbins seemed to grasp this one,
and a gleam came into his faded eyes.</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&ldquo;Four shillin&rsquo; a week,&rdquo; he
repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;What kind o&rsquo; chap be you
a-goin&rsquo; to get for that money, master?&nbsp; Why, the lads
&rsquo;nd scarce frighten the crows for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmer coughed again and gently prodded the ground with
his pitchfork, watching the operation with apparently intent
interest for a moment or two.&nbsp; Then he slowly raised his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be a-gettin&rsquo; eight shillin&rsquo; a
week, shepherd.&nbsp; Ye see, &rsquo;tis this way.&nbsp; We be
a-payin&rsquo; you twelve shillin&rsquo; now, we be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robbins nodded.&nbsp; He had ceased to rub his hands, but
stood with the palms still tightly pressed together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ye see, we didn&rsquo;t a-grudge it ye.&nbsp; Ye
was wuth it to us, shepherd&mdash;while ye was strong an&rsquo;
hearty ye was wuth it to us,&rdquo; he repeated handsomely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But now, ye bain&rsquo;t fit for much, and that&rsquo;s
the trewth; &rsquo;tis no fault o&rsquo; yourn, but ye
bain&rsquo;t.&nbsp; We lost a terrible lot o&rsquo; lambs last
year.&nbsp; Ye be too stiff in your joints to get about quick,
an&rsquo; ye can&rsquo;t get through your work.&nbsp; It comes
hard on we, ye see, to be payin&rsquo; out good money an&rsquo;
not gettin&rsquo; the money value&mdash;an&rsquo; it comes hard
on you too, now ye be a-gettin&rsquo; into years, shepherd, to be
strivin&rsquo; an&rsquo; contrivin&rsquo; like, an&rsquo; <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>bibberin&rsquo;
in the frostiss an&rsquo; snow stuff, an standin&rsquo; out
o&rsquo; nights when the rheumatics is bad.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
cruel hard for ye, shepherd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, sure,&rdquo; agreed Robbins more readily than
usual.&nbsp; He did not in the least see the drift of the
farmer&rsquo;s argument, but felt that the last proposition was
indubitably true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So ye see &rsquo;tis this way: I lose four
shillin&rsquo; a week by hirin&rsquo; a chap to help &rsquo;ee,
and you lose four shillin&rsquo; a week.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll pay him
eight shillin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll pay you eight
shillin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; ye&rsquo;ll divide the work between
ye.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it, do ye see?&rdquo; said Farmer Joyce
confidentially.&nbsp; &ldquo;Divide the work an&rsquo; divide the
wage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robbins stared at him, vacantly at first, then with a growing
sense of indignation as he began dimly to understand the nature
of the proposal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree, master,&rdquo; he said, after a
moment&rsquo;s pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, that I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
I never axed no help, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not a-goin&rsquo; to
divide no wage.&nbsp; Twelve shillin&rsquo; a week is what I did
agree for, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve a-had it for twenty year
an&rsquo; more.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t do with no less now nor I did
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo; argued the farmer, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
this way, ye see, I can&rsquo;t afford to be at a loss.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve a-stood it as long as I could, shepherd, but I <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>can&rsquo;t
noways let things go wrong this season same as last; I
can&rsquo;t truly.&nbsp; Ye mustn&rsquo;t be onreasonable.&nbsp;
Why, look &rsquo;ee&mdash;d&rsquo;ye know any man o&rsquo; your
years in these parts as gets twelve shillin&rsquo; a week?&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s the natur&rsquo; o&rsquo; things as when they
can&rsquo;t do the full day&rsquo;s work they can&rsquo;t have
the full day&rsquo;s pay.&nbsp; Look at Adam Blanchard and Eddard
Boyt yon.&nbsp; When they began to falter they made up their
minds to it and went back to eight shillin&rsquo; a week same as
their grandsons do get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; agreed Robbins bitterly, &ldquo;little chaps
leavin&rsquo; school gets eight shillin&rsquo; a
week&mdash;it&rsquo;s bwoy&rsquo;s wage, bwoy&rsquo;s
wage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; very good wage too,&rdquo; retorted the
farmer, now as much nettled as was possible for one of his placid
nature.&nbsp; &ldquo;You ought to take it an&rsquo; be thankful,
Abel Robbins.&nbsp; Many a man &rsquo;ud be proud an&rsquo; glad
to earn as much an&rsquo; have it paid reg&rsquo;lar.&nbsp; Many
a able-bodied man wi&rsquo; a family,&rdquo; he added
impressively.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis enough an&rsquo; more than
enough for you, a lone man wi&rsquo; no one dependin&rsquo; on
ye, so to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, I am a lone man, I am that,&rdquo; agreed the
shepherd warmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo; why am I a lone
man?&nbsp; When I worked for ye first, <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>after your father died, says you,
&lsquo;We must have a single man,&rsquo; says you.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
must have ye on the spot,&rsquo; says you, &lsquo;with all them
dumb things about the place to see to.&rsquo;&nbsp; So I give up
walkin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; the maid I was coortin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
give up the notion o&rsquo; gettin&rsquo; wed.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
when you got married yourself your missus sent me to lodge in the
village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, an&rsquo; why didn&rsquo;t ye get tied up
then?&rdquo; returned Joyce, with no less heat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,
that&rsquo;s nigh forty year ago.&nbsp; You have had time, sure,
to pick a wife between this an&rsquo; then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abel stared at him reflectively.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d got
used to bein&rsquo; without one,&rdquo; he said, dropping his
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was goin&rsquo; on thirty, then.&nbsp; Ay,
it was too late.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d given up the thought o&rsquo;
womankind, an&rsquo; &rsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t have seemed
nait&rsquo;ral like.&nbsp; But I could wish now that I did
ha&rsquo; married an&rsquo; had childern to keep me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye mid ha&rsquo; been without &rsquo;em,&rdquo; replied
Joyce, once more placid and thoughtful.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay,
shepherd, &rsquo;tis very like you would.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
nothin&rsquo; in my opinion more disappointin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
onsartin than wedlock.&nbsp; There was my mother, a poor ailing
thing, an&rsquo; Lard, what a family she did have to be
sure!&nbsp; The babbies used to be like rabbits&mdash;&rsquo;pon
me word they <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>was.&nbsp; But they died most of &rsquo;em, an&rsquo;
only a matter o&rsquo; half a-dozen o&rsquo; us grew up.&nbsp;
Well now, look at my missus&mdash;she be a fine, strong, healthy
woman, bain&rsquo;t she?&nbsp; Never had chick nor child, as the
sayin&rsquo; goes.&nbsp; An&rsquo; my first wife, ye mind her,
Abel?&nbsp; She was a straight woman an&rsquo; a stout un,
an&rsquo; the only child she had was a poor nesh little thing,
that withered away, ye may say, as soon as it was born.&nbsp; Ye
mightn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; had no children, shepherd, an&rsquo; if
so be ye had wed ye&rsquo;d have had the wife to keep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; assented Abel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s another thing,&rdquo; pursued
the farmer, following up his advantage, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;d
ha&rsquo; married when ye was a young un, your sons would be
gettin&rsquo; into years pretty well by now themselves.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;d have wives an&rsquo; families o&rsquo; their
own.&nbsp; Lard bless you! that they would, an&rsquo; where
&rsquo;ud you be among &rsquo;em all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This flight of imagination was too much for Robbins, who did
not attempt to follow it.&nbsp; He came back instead to the point
at issue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight shillin&rsquo; a week,&rdquo; he repeated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis what your father give me when I first worked
for en.&nbsp; Ay, I worked for en for that an&rsquo; kept
myself.&nbsp; You mind the time, master; you were <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>a young un
too yourself&mdash;there is but a two year atween us, but
you&rsquo;ve wore well, fanner; a deal better nor I.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis the good food, I daresay&mdash;ay, ay, it makes a lot
of difference.&nbsp; Good keep makes fat sheep, as the
sayin&rsquo; goes.&nbsp; A man laisses twice as long if his
victuals is nourishin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, I do &rsquo;low you&rsquo;re tough
though,&rdquo; laughed his master good-naturedly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll see me down, maybe.&nbsp; You come of a
long-lived race, shepherd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, eight shillin&rsquo; a week yer father give
me,&rdquo; repeated Robbins, reverting to his original statement,
and once more rubbing his hands and blinking his dim eyes as
though in the effort to gaze back on that distant past.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I mind &rsquo;twas thought wonderful high pay i&rsquo;
them days; folks was gettin&rsquo; six shillin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
five, but yer father said I was wuth it to en; an&rsquo; when he
died an&rsquo; I went to live yonder with you ye give me eight
shillin&rsquo; a week an&rsquo; my keep&mdash;ay, that was
summat, I was hearty enough then.&nbsp; Ye give me that for ten
year, an&rsquo; then ye got married an&rsquo; I must shift to the
village, an&rsquo; then ye give me ten shillin&rsquo; a
week.&nbsp; And when I were fifty year of age I up an&rsquo; I
says to you, &lsquo;Master,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
a-sarved ye twenty-five year now an&rsquo; ye must <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>raise
me,&rsquo; says I, d&rsquo;ye mind?&nbsp; So ye rose me two
shillin&rsquo;, didn&rsquo;t ye?&nbsp; Well, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve
had twelve shillin&rsquo; a week ever since,&rdquo; he summed up,
and his eyes, which had been travelling slowly back over the
years, reverted altogether to the present and fixed themselves
reproachfully on his master&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo;
now I be to have bwoy&rsquo;s pay again, be I?&rdquo; he queried
with an almost childish quiver and droop of the under lip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Abel, &rsquo;tis onfortunate&mdash;terrible
onfortunate, &rsquo;tis truely.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m fair puzzled, I
am,&rdquo; returned the farmer, much moved himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Look at it whichever way you will it don&rsquo;t seem
fair, but there&rsquo;s a deal o&rsquo; difference between the
look o&rsquo; things an&rsquo; the real natur&rsquo; of
em&rsquo;, shepherd.&nbsp; Look at figures now, an&rsquo;
prices.&nbsp; Lard, when ye count by pence ye seem to have such a
lot you&rsquo;re fair puzzled wi&rsquo; addin&rsquo; &rsquo;em
up&mdash;a body &rsquo;ud need to have twenty fingers instead of
a cluster o&rsquo; five.&nbsp; But put &rsquo;em into
shillin&rsquo;s an&rsquo; where are ye?&nbsp; An&rsquo; put
&rsquo;em into pounds, ah&mdash;&rdquo; here the farmer drew in
his breath with a sucking sound that implied volumes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;An&rsquo; yet it be all the same money, Abel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shepherd, looking at him still reproachfully, shook his
head.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;I know nothin&rsquo; about figures, master; all I
know is &rsquo;tis cruel hard that when I&rsquo;ve a-worked all
my days for &rsquo;ee, Farmer Joyce, you turn on me i&rsquo; my
ancient years.&nbsp; It be hard, an&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t say no
different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the third time that day Mr. Joyce&rsquo;s usually equable
temper was disturbed.&nbsp; He now spoke angrily, partly to end
the dispute, for the sight of Abel Robbins&rsquo; haggard,
reproachful face was almost more than he could bear, partly
because he was vexed at the pertinacity with which the old fellow
adhered to his own point of view, partly because his kind heart
smote him for the course of action he was about to pursue, though
his judgment held it to be just.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;tis this way, Robbins,&rdquo; he cried
roughly, &ldquo;take it or leave it, an&rsquo; please
yourself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve made ye a fair offer, an&rsquo; more
than a fair offer.&nbsp; I can get another man to do all the work
for ten shillin&rsquo; a week&mdash;men be plenty an&rsquo; work
be scarce&mdash;&rsquo;tis clear loss of six shillin&rsquo; a
week out o&rsquo; my own pocket, an&rsquo; if I&rsquo;m
willin&rsquo; to put up with it you should be content; I&rsquo;ll
stick to my bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I bain&rsquo;t content, master,&rdquo; cried
Robbins, a dull fire coming into his eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
sooner leave&mdash;I&rsquo;d sooner give notice&mdash;ay, that I
would.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Farmer
Joyce raised hands and eyes to Heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard such talk from a reasonable man.&nbsp; If
you do leave me, how be you a-goin&rsquo; to live?&nbsp;
Who&rsquo;s a-going to take you on as a new hand if you leave
me?&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll be the House, man.&nbsp; There, don&rsquo;t
talk so foolish like.&nbsp; Think it over an&rsquo; give me your
answer on Saturday.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not hear a word on&rsquo;t
till then.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s never my way to be hasty.&nbsp; Take
time, shepherd; take time.&nbsp; When you&rsquo;ve a-thought it
over you&rsquo;ll find it&rsquo;s not such a bad
bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned away and strode down the hill, crook and pitchfork
on shoulder.&nbsp; Robbins made no effort to detain him, but
stood watching the receding figure in a dazed way till it
disappeared at the angle of the lane.&nbsp; Then he walked back
slowly to the enclosure where the sheep were still feeding and
stood for a moment or two looking at them according to his
custom, but without noticing them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be mazed,&rdquo; he said to himself; &ldquo;I be fair
mazed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gradually he woke to the consciousness that his limbs were
trembling under him, and his head dizzy, and leaving the sheep
pen he <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>entered the hut and sat down on the solitary chair which
it contained.&nbsp; In one corner, curled up on an old coat that
Robbins sometimes put on when the nights were exceptionally cold,
lay his dog, which, on his master&rsquo;s entrance, opened its
eyes without raising its head and wagged its tail in
welcome.&nbsp; The keen yellow eyes remained fixed on
Robbins&rsquo; face, and after a time the tail ceased wagging,
and the dog stiffly rose, shook itself, and pattered across the
floor to the shepherd&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; Finding still no
return, it laid its head upon Abel&rsquo;s knee, looking up into
his face with such a world of dumb questioning anguish that it at
length elicited a response.&nbsp; Robbins stretched out his hand,
which still shook oddly, and patted the tawny head,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, Bob, I see thee,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there,
down, down!&rdquo; as the dog, springing up, began to lick his
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t help it, boy; we&rsquo;re to be
chucked out, thee and I.&nbsp; You be getting old, too, an&rsquo;
&rsquo;tis a sin to be old i&rsquo; these times.&nbsp; Nobody
wants us, Bob.&nbsp; If some folks had their will you an&rsquo;
me &rsquo;ud be knocked on the head, Bob; an&rsquo; I do
&rsquo;low it &rsquo;ud be the best way.&nbsp; I could
a&rsquo;most wish as somebody &rsquo;ud come up without my
knowing it <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>an&rsquo; jest&mdash;settle me.&nbsp; Livin&rsquo;s poor
work when folk be wishin&rsquo; to be rid on ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob slid on to the floor again and laid his old white muzzle
on the worn corduroy knee; and Abel continued to stroke his head,
but without speaking, until at last the sympathetic eyes closed,
and the dog dozed, still pressing close to him.&nbsp; Then Abel
suffered his hand to drop and sat as before, staring blankly at
the wall in front of him.</p>
<p>Saturday came, one of those mild, south country days when
winter seems to give place to spring; the sky was blue, thrushes
were singing; the air was soft and fragrant, almost as with the
spicy smell of mounting sap and growing herbage.&nbsp; Farmer
Joyce toiled up the hill again with his smock frock thrown open,
and his hat on the back of his head.&nbsp; His face, too, was
full of a mild radiance as he paused within the gate of the
enclosure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well shepherd?&rdquo; he said interrogatively.</p>
<p>Robbins had been turning over the litter within the pens, and
continued his occupation for a moment or two, the sun gleaming on
his white hair and the golden straw.&nbsp; Then he drove the
pitchfork slowly into the ground and turned round, holding
himself erect; his old dog came shambling forward and stood by
his side.</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>&ldquo;Well, farmer,&rdquo; said Abel grimly, &ldquo;I
be goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His master stood gazing at him, shading his eyes with his
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;When be ye goin&rsquo;, shepherd?&rdquo; he
asked still mildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This day week,&rdquo; returned the shepherd
briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How be goin&rsquo; to live, Abel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robbins made no reply.&nbsp; Farmer Joyce thumped the gate
with his massive brown fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll starve, Abel, that&rsquo;s what ye&rsquo;ll
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; cried Abel, thumping the gate too
with his lean old hand, &ldquo;I will starve, farmer.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t care so much if I do starve; livin&rsquo;s weary
work&mdash;the sooner I be done with it the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shepherd, shepherd,&rdquo; expostulated Farmer Joyce in
real distress and perplexity, &ldquo;this be fool&rsquo;s
talk&mdash;this be nothin&rsquo; but stubbornness.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll not take such an answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye may take it,&rdquo; retorted Robbins, thumping the
gate again, &ldquo;for ye&rsquo;ll not get no other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I be sorry, Abel; I be very sorry&mdash;I&mdash;I
be terrible sorry.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve sarved me faithful,
Abel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, master, I do &rsquo;low I&rsquo;ve sarved &rsquo;ee
too faithful,&rdquo; returned Robbins.&nbsp; He betook <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>himself to
his pitchfork again, and all his master&rsquo;s remonstrances
failed to extract another word.</p>
<p>Sorely perturbed in mind Joyce withdrew at last, and made his
way homewards.&nbsp; Throwing down his hat on the kitchen table
he informed his wife of the result of the interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could a&rsquo;most wish as we hadn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo;
said nothin&rsquo; about it to the old chap.&nbsp; He won&rsquo;t
last long&mdash;an&rsquo; I might ha&rsquo; made shift to help
him a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That be real nonsense,&rdquo; returned his better
half.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Twould be a pretty notion for the
master to be a-workin&rsquo; for the man.&nbsp; Let him go if
he&rsquo;s set on&rsquo;t&mdash;he&rsquo;ll repent it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She set a dish on the table with somewhat unnecessary energy,
and her husband held his peace for a moment or two.&nbsp;
By-and-bye, however, he put into words that which was in the
minds of both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be like to repent it, too.&nbsp; Abel be
wonderful handy about the place.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis but his
j&rsquo;ints as is straggled.&nbsp; He be no Sammy, shepherd
bain&rsquo;t; his head&rsquo;s wise enough yet if his body be
tewly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do &rsquo;low ye didn&rsquo;t take him the right
way,&rdquo; said Mrs. Joyce, looking at her husband with severe
disapproval.&nbsp; &ldquo;Men-folk be all alike, they&rsquo;ve no
notion o&rsquo; things.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll lay a <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>shillin&rsquo; ye took en rough like&mdash;told en he
weren&rsquo;t good for nothin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; vexed en so that
he were fair dathered.&nbsp; Leave en to me, I&rsquo;ll talk to
en a bit, an&rsquo; see what I can make of en.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she banged another plate upon the table and added
somewhat inconsequently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no patience with
en&mdash;nor you neither&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Later in the day she was standing, knitting in hand, watching
a brood of very young chickens which had made their appearance at
an astonishingly early date.&nbsp; Despite this fact they were
hardy, healthy little things, and Mrs. Joyce smiled as she
watched them running in and out from under their mother, picking
up the meal she threw them with great alertness and
enjoyment.</p>
<p>Mrs. Joyce was a tall, large woman with sandy hair, from which
the sun now brought out pretty lights.&nbsp; She had the temper
which usually accompanies such hair, easily roused and as easily
appeased.&nbsp; The mere sight of these yellow, fluffy chickens,
the consciousness of the sunshine, and the fragrance, and
suggestiveness, had filled her with a kind of hazy content.&nbsp;
The wall-flowers yonder under the kitchen windows were already
ablow, she observed.&nbsp; The pigs, too, were coming on <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>nicely; the
calf, which was bleating not unmusically in one of the outhouses,
had had the good sense to be a heifer.&nbsp; Altogether Mrs.
Joyce felt that the world was not a bad place and that life was
worth living.</p>
<p>She was in this frame of mind when, chancing to raise her
eyes, she saw the figure of Shepherd Robbins shambling slowly
down the steep &ldquo;pinch&rdquo; of road that led to the farm
gate.&nbsp; Perhaps it was the sudden contrast between that gaunt
form, that haggard, melancholy face, and the surrounding
brightness and prosperity that moved her, perhaps because, being
a good-hearted woman in the main, she shared her husband&rsquo;s
regret at the course events were taking; in any case at sight of
him her anger melted away, and a flood of genuine pity swept over
her heart.</p>
<p>She went to meet Robbins at the gate and laid her hand kindly
on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, shepherd,&rdquo; she said, and her pleasant voice
assumed an inflection that was almost tender, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
never true what my husband tells me?&nbsp; You bain&rsquo;t
a-thinkin&rsquo; of leaving we?&nbsp; We couldn&rsquo;t get on
without &rsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes an unexpected kind word from a person whom we have
distrusted, and perhaps disliked, carries more weight than a
similar <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>one from a friend.&nbsp; Poor Robbins had been dogged
and surly enough with the master whom he loved, but when the
missus, with whom he had hitherto lived, as it were, on the
defensive, spoke so gently and looked so kind, he gazed back at
her astonished, softened, confounded.</p>
<p>And when she said again: &ldquo;Why, shepherd, you
bain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to desert we?&rdquo; he suddenly burst
into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said brokenly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;what be I to do?&rdquo;&nbsp; The tears
were running down his face.&nbsp; &ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low
I&rsquo;d be loth to leave master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you mustn&rsquo;t think on it,&rdquo; returned
Mrs. Joyce decidedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t do without
you.&nbsp; See&mdash;&rsquo;tis all a bit o&rsquo; temper,
bain&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; You never truly meant to give
notice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, missus; I did,&rdquo; sobbed the old man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It bain&rsquo;t temper neither, it&mdash;it be the notion,
I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all it be, sure,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Joyce, not in the least knowing what he meant, but speaking in
soothing tones and patting his arm kindly; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis but
a notion, Abel.&nbsp; Eight shillin&rsquo; bain&rsquo;t so bad,
you know&mdash;come.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll never want so long as you
&rsquo;arn eight shillin&rsquo; a week&mdash;eight shillin&rsquo;
a week &rsquo;ll keep you, wunt it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>&ldquo;Ay, it&rsquo;ll keep me, missus&mdash;it
bain&rsquo;t that.&nbsp; But I do &rsquo;low it&rsquo;ll be main
hard to go up on pay-day wi&rsquo; &rsquo;em all, an&rsquo; take
laiss nor any of &rsquo;em&mdash;me that has always took the
most.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll all be castin&rsquo; eyes at me
an&rsquo; talkin&rsquo; small o&rsquo; me.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll be
sayin&rsquo;, &lsquo;Shepherd be takin&rsquo; bwoy&rsquo;s
wage.&nbsp; He bain&rsquo;t worth his salt now, shepherd
bain&rsquo;t.&rsquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the notion o&rsquo; that,
missus, as I can&rsquo;t stand&mdash;nohow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s what it be,&rdquo; returned his
mistress thoughtfully.</p>
<p>The excitement which rendered Robbins so unusually garrulous
had flushed his cheeks and given light to his eyes.&nbsp; The
woman&rsquo;s heart was touched as she looked at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ma&rsquo;am, an&rsquo; another thing&mdash;the lad
as I be to have help me, he&rsquo;ll be a cheeky un very
like&mdash;the ruck o&rsquo; lads be.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll think
himself as good as me&mdash;better mayhap.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be
gettin&rsquo; same money as me, ye know.&nbsp; What&rsquo;ll he
think o&rsquo; me at my time o&rsquo; life?&nbsp; Adam Blanchard
and Eddard Boyt they be gettin&rsquo; same as their grandsons I
d&rsquo; &rsquo;low, but there! the boys be their grandsons,
an&rsquo; if they don&rsquo;t treat &rsquo;em respectful-like
they can give &rsquo;em the stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Joyce was silent for a moment, her brows were knit and
her lips compressed; she <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>seemed to be turning over a problem
in her mind.&nbsp; Suddenly her face lit up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m o&rsquo; your
mind arter all.&nbsp; I think instead o&rsquo; your master
cuttin&rsquo; off your wages he ought to raise you.&nbsp; You
ought to have some reward for your long years of faithful
service.&nbsp; In my opinion your master ought to raise you to
sixteen shillin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shepherd Robbins looked as though he scarcely heard
aright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, missus!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and paused
overcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; if master raises you, nobody couldn&rsquo;t vex
you, an&rsquo; yet nobody couldn&rsquo;t find aught amiss.&nbsp;
The master &rsquo;ud tell &rsquo;em all &rsquo;twas but
nat&rsquo;ral after ye bein&rsquo; wi&rsquo; us so long an&rsquo;
so punished wi&rsquo; rheumatics.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s time he should
do something more for &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; An&rsquo; so, he&rsquo;d
say, he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to raise you an&rsquo; you be
goin&rsquo; to keep a lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robbins still stared, astonishment and delight vying with each
other in his face.&nbsp; &ldquo;That &rsquo;ud be a different
story!&rdquo; he ejaculated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;, you see, you could pick your own bwoy easy
then&mdash;he&rsquo;d be your bwoy; you could choose en for
yourself, an&rsquo; send en away if he didn&rsquo;t behave
hisself.&nbsp; Would that do ye?&rdquo; she asked with modest
triumph.</p>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>&ldquo;Do me!&mdash;ah, that it would!&nbsp; I did never
expect so much.&nbsp; But master won&rsquo;t hear on it,
sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will, though&mdash;I&rsquo;ll see to that.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis but your due, shepherd.&nbsp; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low
you deserve some reward; we bain&rsquo;t onreasonable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned quickly, and went into the house, leaving Robbins
radiant but still half incredulous.</p>
<p>He was forced to believe in his own good fortune, however,
when at pay time Farmer Joyce announced the intended promotion of
Shepherd Robbins, who, in view of his long service and failing
health, was now to receive an increase of wages amounting to four
shillings a week.</p>
<p>The shepherd bore himself with becoming modesty under the
congratulations of his comrades.&nbsp; One or two of them were
disposed to be envious, but for the most part they received the
intelligence in an ungrudging spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do say that you be goin&rsquo; to keep a bwoy,
shepherd,&rdquo; remarked the ploughman a little later, gazing at
him with respectful admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very like I be,&rdquo; returned Abel loftily.&nbsp; He
was not proud, but thoroughly aware of his own importance.</p>
<p><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>One of
the other men, the father of a family, humbly mentioned that he
had a fine well-grown lad at home that would, maybe, suit Mr.
Robbins as well as another, and Abel graciously promised to think
of it.</p>
<p>He went home thoroughly convinced that a piece of most
unexpected good luck had befallen him, an opinion which was
shared by all his neighbours.&nbsp; As for Mr. and Mrs. Joyce
they kept their own counsel.</p>

27</span>PRIVATE GRIGGS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> November landscape was sombre
and melancholy enough; brown, newly-ploughed fields alternating
for the most part with the tawny stubble of land that still lay
fallow.&nbsp; A few withered leaves clung to the branches of
trees and hedges; the sky was grey, the air heavy and yet
cold.&nbsp; It was a fit day to hear news of trouble, Mrs.
Frizzell thought, as her eyes roamed over the prospect, not
vaguely as another woman&rsquo;s might have done, but with a
definite object in view.</p>
<p>She proceeded at a round pace up the lane, and along the high
road, leaving it, after half a mile or so, to strike across the
fields.</p>
<p>She was a small, energetic-looking woman, with hazel eyes and
prematurely grey hair.&nbsp; Her usually cheerful face was deadly
pale to-day, and its characteristically alert expression had
given place to one of devouring anxiety.</p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>Presently against the sky-line above a distant hedge
appeared the head and shoulders of a man, and a little way in
front of him the ears and crests of two horses.&nbsp; Mrs.
Frizzell quickened her pace, making for a familiar gap in the
hedge aforesaid, through which she presently squeezed
herself.</p>
<p>The man, who had not seen her, continued his slow progress
across the field.&nbsp; Without calling out to him she broke into
a run, her feet sinking deep at every step in the newly turned-up
soil; after a few minutes she reached him, panting, and laid her
hand upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>He looked round with a start, and brought his horses to a
standstill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martha! what brings ye out at this time o&rsquo;
day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing good,&rdquo; said Martha.&nbsp; She threw a
hasty glance round.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be there any one
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke in a peculiarly loud and distinct key, and he
answered in the low, mumbling tone habitual to deaf people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, who should be about?&nbsp; There bain&rsquo;t
nobody here but myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go with &rsquo;ee to the top
o&rsquo; the hill and make sure&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want nobody
to hear <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>what I&rsquo;ve a-got to tell &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; Go
on&mdash;go on to the top o&rsquo; the drill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be to go forrard?&rdquo; questioned her husband,
staring at her stupidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ees, take them harses up to the top o&rsquo; the
drill, and then I&rsquo;ll talk to &rsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frizzell admonished his horses to proceed, and went plodding
on up the rising ground along which he had traced his furrow,
glancing round every now and then at the set face of his wife as
she plodded in his rear.</p>
<p>He was a big, blond, good-natured man, whose natural dulness
of wit was intensified by his infirmity.</p>
<p>When they reached the brow of the hill Martha slipped in front
of him, and standing on tip-toe, cast a searching glance
round.&nbsp; A flock of sheep was penned in a corner of the
adjacent turnip-field, a few rooks were waddling up the furrows
nearer at hand; over their heads a heron was slowly sailing with
wide, sweeping wings on his way to the river, but not a human
creature was in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said John Frizzell as she turned towards
him, &ldquo;whatever be the matter, Missus?&nbsp; I wish
you&rsquo;d out wi&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had a letter from my cousin Julia, <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Father, and
she have telled me some bad noos about our Susan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s jaw dropped, and the colour forsook his face,
leaving it pale beneath its tan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;be the maid took ill?&rdquo; he inquired with
a gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She bain&rsquo;t well&mdash;and she bain&rsquo;t like
to be well.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ve a-been ill-used, Father.&nbsp;
There, the silly girl wouldn&rsquo;t hearken to what I did
al&rsquo;ays tell her, an&rsquo; now she be sufferin&rsquo;
for&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ve been an&rsquo; took up wi&rsquo;
a soldier, an&rsquo; so far as I can make out he made a purtence
o&rsquo; marryin&rsquo; her; got some raskil to dress up as a
minister, an&rsquo; put on the ring and all.&nbsp; The poor maid
was sure she was married honest, but she kep&rsquo; it secret,
for he dared her to tell any one wi&rsquo;out he gave her
leave.&nbsp; Well, an&rsquo; now he&rsquo;ve a-gone off to the
war, and left a letter for her sayin&rsquo; as how &rsquo;twere
all humbug, an&rsquo; they wasn&rsquo;t married at all, an&rsquo;
hopin&rsquo; she&rsquo;d forgive en.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; said the poor father, and he brought his
hand down on the plough-handle with a force that made the mild
horses start, &ldquo;My God!&nbsp; I wish I had en
here&mdash;I&rsquo;d smash en!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s not all,&rdquo; went on Mrs.
Frizzell, in a choked voice; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a little
&rsquo;un upon <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>the road&mdash;our daughter &rsquo;ull be disgraced
afore the whole parish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disgraced!&rdquo; cried John, his honest face as red as
it had before been pale, &ldquo;who says <i>disgraced</i>!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no fault o&rsquo; the poor
child&rsquo;s!&nbsp; She&rsquo;ve a-been deceived and used cruel
hard.&nbsp; Nobody &rsquo;ull not have a word to say against
<i>her</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they, though!&rdquo; retorted his wife,
who, though as sore at heart as he, thought it necessary to
assume an aggressive tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who do you suppose
&rsquo;ull ever believe as the girl &rsquo;ud be so simple as to
be took in and think herself married when she warn&rsquo;t
married?&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t believe it in Darchester, I can
tell &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; There, they&rsquo;ve a-gone and sent her
away from her situation; and Julia&mdash;why I can see as my own
cousin Julia don&rsquo;t half believe her
story&mdash;she&rsquo;ve wrote to say she &rsquo;opes I&rsquo;ll
come and take her away at once, as she don&rsquo;t like her for
to be comin&rsquo; to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, write an&rsquo; tell her as you will take her
away,&rdquo; returned Frizzell in a kind of muffled roar.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I bain&rsquo;t ashamed o&rsquo; my child, whatever other
folks may be.&nbsp; Write an&rsquo; tell her as Father an&rsquo;
Mother &rsquo;ull be fain to have her home, and won&rsquo;t let
nobody worrit her when she d&rsquo; get there.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
soon shut their <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>mouths if they try to make out as she bain&rsquo;t
a-tellin&rsquo; the trewth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Father, you listen to I.&rdquo;&nbsp; And here
Martha laid both her hands upon his great round shoulders and
fairly shook him in her eagerness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I bain&rsquo;t
a-goin&rsquo; for to let her tell the trewth&mdash;not all the
trewth.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m willin&rsquo; she should say she got
married to a soldier unbeknown to us, but I don&rsquo;t mean to
let the rest come out.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; for to give
out as he were killed in the war.&nbsp; That way he&rsquo;ll be
done wi&rsquo;, so to speak&mdash;nobody &rsquo;ull be
axin&rsquo; questions about en, or wonderin&rsquo; why Susan have
come home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Frizzell fairly gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my heart!&rdquo; he ejaculated, staring at his
eager little wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, what a tale!&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t much fancy tellin&rsquo; sich a pack o&rsquo; lies;
nay, now&rdquo;&mdash;and he rolled his head
obstinately&mdash;&ldquo;I bain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to tell
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll speak the trewth, and knock down them
as says contrairy&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be danged if I
won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee be sich a fool, Father.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll do jist as I tell &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
al&rsquo;ays held up my head, and Susan, she&rsquo;ve
al&rsquo;ays been a bit high, an&rsquo; have a-kep&rsquo; herself
to herself, and there be folks as &rsquo;ud be only too glad to
go a-crowin&rsquo; over we, an&rsquo; a-backbitin&rsquo; of
we.&nbsp; I bain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; for <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>to give
&rsquo;em no cause.&nbsp; You keep your mouth
shut&mdash;that&rsquo;s all as you&rsquo;ve got to do.&nbsp; Keep
your mouth shut, and if folks d&rsquo; come a-worrettin&rsquo; of
&rsquo;ee wi&rsquo; questions, don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee let on for
to understand.&nbsp; You be hard enough o&rsquo; hearin&rsquo; at
all times, and you can jist make out to be a bit harder.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll have to do as I do bid &rsquo;ee, for I&rsquo;ve
telled Mrs. Cross jist now the story about Susan&rsquo;s husband
bein&rsquo; killed in the war, and his name an&rsquo;
all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, do &rsquo;ee know his name?&rdquo; interrupted
Frizzell, staring at her in a puzzled sort of way.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What be his name?&nbsp; The young raskil!&nbsp; If he
bain&rsquo;t killed out abroad, I&rsquo;ll half murder en when he
do come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martha&rsquo;s face assumed a set expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t deserve for to come back,&rdquo; she
said, in a tone too low for her husband to hear.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There, it bain&rsquo;t Christian to wish ill to nobody,
but the A&rsquo;mighty be just, and I can&rsquo;t think as
He&rsquo;d let a blessin&rsquo; rest on that there wicked
fellow.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know his name no more nor you,&rdquo;
she shouted, turning to John, who was still muttering
vengeance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Julia didn&rsquo;t tell I; but when Mrs.
Cross axed straight out what his name mid be, I had to say
summat.&nbsp; I weren&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; for to tell her as I
didn&rsquo;t know, so I jist thought of a name <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>as I seed in
the paper o&rsquo; Sunday among the list o&rsquo;
killed&mdash;Private Griggs&mdash;so I telled her &rsquo;twas
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John stared at her solemnly and with unwilling admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye be wonderful quick at makin&rsquo; out things, and I
do suppose it bain&rsquo;t no use for I to go against ye; but I
don&rsquo;t believe no good &rsquo;ull come o&rsquo; it.&nbsp;
Mrs. Cross be a terrible one to talk&mdash;she&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo;
spread the tale over village by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will,&rdquo; agreed Martha.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
jist for that I did tell her.&nbsp; I must be gettin&rsquo; back
now,&rdquo; she continued, in an altered tone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee be took back when &rsquo;ee see
blinds down, Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blinds down!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, because Private Griggs be killed,&rdquo; returned
Mrs. Frizzell grimly.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; to be
kep&rsquo; down till I&rsquo;ve a-fetched the widow
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The widow!&rdquo; exclaimed John.&nbsp; And he fairly
burst out crying.&nbsp; &ldquo;My poor little Susie!&nbsp; My
poor maidie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his back to his wife and stood for a moment with his
shoulders convulsively heaving; then, rubbing his eyes with one
horny hand, he shouted huskily to the horses, <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>ordered his
wife gruffly to stand out of the way, and started off down the
hill again.</p>
<p>Mrs. Frizzell struck off at right angles across the field, and
made for home with all possible speed.&nbsp; Her heart was full,
nigh to bursting, and the lump in her throat caused her almost
intolerable physical distress, but she resolutely forced the
tears back.&nbsp; This was no time for crying&mdash;there was too
much to be done&mdash;too much to be thought of.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>It was about noon on the following day when Mrs. Frizzell
arrived at Susan&rsquo;s lodging.</p>
<p>The poor girl ran to meet her with an inarticulate cry, and
the mother, without looking at her, began to talk rapidly in her
characteristically matter-of-fact fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be come to take &rsquo;ee home, my dear&mdash;Father
an&rsquo; me think &rsquo;tis best&mdash;you&rsquo;d better be
gettin&rsquo; your things together.&nbsp; There, I did start so
early as I could, but I had to go into one or two shops, and it
did take I sich a time to find out this place!&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;d
best make haste and do your packing; there&rsquo;s the getting
back to be thought on.&nbsp; You can put up all as you&rsquo;ve
a-got &rsquo;cept your black dress&mdash;ye can slip that
on.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got everythin&rsquo; else as ye be like to
want here.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>&ldquo;My black dress!&rdquo; said Susie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis too good for travellin&rsquo;, mother; this
here blue be quite tidy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do what I tell &rsquo;ee,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frizzell,
sternly, looking up from the parcel which she was unfastening,
and fixing her eyes for the first time on the girl&rsquo;s pale,
agitated face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, why have you got your blacks on?&rdquo; cried
Susan in sudden alarm.&nbsp; &ldquo;And, oh! what&rsquo;s that in
your hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a bonnet, my dear, and you be to put it
on.&nbsp; Now, Susan, I haven&rsquo;t said one cross word to
&rsquo;ee, and I bain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to say a cross word
to &rsquo;ee; and Father and me have a-made up our minds to stand
by &rsquo;ee, and we&rsquo;ll not let nobody go
a-worrettin&rsquo; of &rsquo;ee, or a-castin&rsquo; up at
&rsquo;ee about what&rsquo;s past.&nbsp; If ye did deceive we,
ye&rsquo;ve a-been punished enough for&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; wailed
Susan; and she threw herself into her mother&rsquo;s arms, her
big, babyish, blue eyes drowned in tears; her poor head, with its
crown of golden hair, hidden on the bosom where it had so often
lain in innocent infancy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was a wicked girl to
deceive &rsquo;ee and dear Father, as was always so good to
me.&nbsp; But he&mdash;Jim&mdash;said I wasn&rsquo;t to tell no
one, or he&rsquo;d be gettin&rsquo; into trouble, as we
wasn&rsquo;t on the strength!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>&ldquo;And what mid that mean, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Mother.&nbsp; Some soldiers&rsquo;
talk.&nbsp; Some of &rsquo;em has leave to get married, an&rsquo;
some hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah-h-h-h, ye mid ha&rsquo; knowed he was up to some
tricks&mdash;ye couldn&rsquo;t be married right that way.&nbsp;
Why, where was your lines, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he was a-keepin&rsquo; them for me, an&rsquo;
he took me to a kind o&rsquo; tin buildin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; said
it was the soldiers&rsquo; chapel, and he knowed I always went to
chapel, so he wouldn&rsquo;t ax me to be married in church; and
there was another man there, as he said was the minister.&nbsp;
And he put the ring on my finger&mdash;Jim did&mdash;he did
indeed&rdquo;&mdash;and here Susan raised her head to look
earnestly in her mother&rsquo;s face&mdash;&ldquo;and he did say
the words, and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, no need to talk more on&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
Ye&rsquo;ve been voolish, my maid, and he&rsquo;ve a-been wicked;
and you be left to pay for it all.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ve got
Father and Mother to look to, and if you&rsquo;ll do as I do bid
&rsquo;ee, nobody need know o&rsquo; the trick as has been played
on &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; There, slip on your dress, my dear, and pop
this bonnet on, and&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, &rsquo;tis a widow&rsquo;s bonnet,&rdquo;
gasped Susan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t make
me wear a <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>widow&rsquo;s bonnet!&nbsp; Oh, I can&rsquo;t bear the
sight of en; it do seem so unlucky, so dreadful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now be still, Susan; I don&rsquo;t want no idle talk
about &rsquo;ee, an&rsquo; no insultin&rsquo; remarks passed, and
I&rsquo;ve a-made out a story and you be to keep
to&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You be the Widow Griggs&mdash;that be your
name; and your husband, what was a soldier, have a-been killed in
this here war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not killed; not killed!&rdquo; cried the girl
wildly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Mother, don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee talk like
that, for I can&rsquo;t a-bear it.&nbsp; There, &rsquo;twould
seem so wicked to be sayin&rsquo; sich things&mdash;the Lard mid
make it come true.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t but feel as Jim be my
husband; whatever he&rsquo;ve a-done, and so bad as he mid be, I
can&rsquo;t ever feel anything else.&nbsp; He did mean to marry I
some day when he&rsquo;d got leave, and he&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; done
it if it hadn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; been for the war.&nbsp; If you
call me a widow, I shall feel all the time as if Jim were really
killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Frizzell folded her arms and gazed at her resolutely and
severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Susan, don&rsquo;t let me hear &rsquo;ee talk like
that&mdash;the man&rsquo;s dead to you if he bain&rsquo;t killed,
an&rsquo; his name mustn&rsquo;t ever be on your lips.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo; the best I can for &rsquo;ee, an&rsquo; I
can&rsquo;t think the Lard &rsquo;ud be angry with me for
makin&rsquo; out a story what does no harm to nobody.&nbsp; As
for <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>that
fellow, he be in the hands o&rsquo; the Lard&mdash;the Lard
&rsquo;ull see to en.&nbsp; I leave en to the
A&rsquo;mighty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Frizzell spoke with a certain almost terrible
significance which made poor Susie&rsquo;s blood run cold.</p>
<p>The stronger will gained the day, and a short time afterwards
the Widow Griggs, clad in her &ldquo;deep,&rdquo; and sobbing in
a heartrending fashion that had no pretence at all about it under
her long veil, was led out of the house by her resolute little
mother.</p>
<p>Mrs. Frizzell was by nature truthful, but in this emergency it
must be owned that her veracity was exposed to tests from which
it did not always escape unscathed.</p>
<p>When one of her neighbours asked her if she did not mean to
apply for relief on her daughter&rsquo;s behalf from some of the
funds instituted for soldiers&rsquo; widows, she could reply
boldly enough that such an appeal would be useless, as Private
Griggs had married without leave, and Susan&rsquo;s claim would
therefore not be recognised.&nbsp; But when the sympathetic, but
exasperatingly pertinacious Mrs. Cross&mdash;the gossip who had
been chosen in the first instance to spread the news of
Susan&rsquo;s bereavement&mdash;plied her with questions anent
her <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>departed son-in-law, the poor woman occasionally found
herself so completely cornered as to be obliged to invent
appropriate answers.</p>
<p>Thus, before very long, it became known in the village that
the late Private Griggs had been a tall, dark man, very
well-looking; that he came from somewhere up the country; that
his mother was breaking her heart about his loss, but his father
did seem to bear up very well.&nbsp; They didn&rsquo;t write
often to Susan&mdash;no, for the poor dear were that undone she
couldn&rsquo;t a-bear so much as to hear his name mentioned; in
fact, Mrs. Frizzell herself did scarcely ever mention it to
her.&nbsp; (&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; remarked the
originator of this history, with infinite satisfaction.)&nbsp; No
more didn&rsquo;t Frizzell&mdash;indeed, poor Frizzell were that
upset about it that the less said to en the better.</p>
<p>Sometimes Mrs. Frizzell was a little startled when these
figments were recalled to her&mdash;many of them, indeed, were so
much embellished by transmission from mouth to mouth that she
scarcely recognised her own original creation; but she deemed it
best to let the story pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em please theirselves,&rdquo; she
murmured.&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say so much as that, but
&rsquo;tis better to let &rsquo;em think so if it do
satis<i>fy</i> &rsquo;em.&nbsp; There,&rdquo; <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>she would
add, when tormented by some particularly keen twinge of
conscience, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis to be &rsquo;oped as the Lard will
forgi&rsquo;e me.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t believe as it &rsquo;ull be
held agen me, seein&rsquo; as it&rsquo;s for the sake of my own
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When poor Susan&rsquo;s baby boy arrived great astonishment
was elicited by the fact that the soft down which covered its
little head was of a distinctly ruddy colour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, to be sure,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Cross, &ldquo;he
can&rsquo;t take after his father, poor, dear little
hinfant.&nbsp; You said he was a black-haired man, didn&rsquo;t
you, Mrs. Frizzell?&nbsp; And Susan&rsquo;s hair be just so
yellow as the corn.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t call to mind as there be
any red-haired folks in your family, or Frizzell&rsquo;s
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very like the poor innocent do take after some o&rsquo;
Mr. Griggs&rsquo; relations,&rdquo; remarked another woman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;His mother, now&mdash;&rsquo;tis strange how often
I&rsquo;ve a-known the first child be the very image o&rsquo; the
father&rsquo;s mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Frizzell&rsquo;s hawk eyes immediately fixed themselves
upon the mental picture of Private Grigg&rsquo;s maternal parent,
and she presently remarked, in a somewhat muffled tone, that she
fancied she had heard summat about old Mrs. Griggs bein&rsquo; a
red-haired woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that makes another of &rsquo;em!&rdquo; she <a

herself, &ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low I&rsquo;ll soon forget what
&rsquo;tis to speak the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning, after the departure of the visitors, to replace the
little flannel-wrapped bundle by its mother&rsquo;s side, she
observed tentatively&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His hair do seem to be red, Susie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ees,&rdquo; returned poor Susie faintly,
&ldquo;his hair be red&mdash;like Jim&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye mid ha&rsquo; told me that, I think!&rdquo;
exclaimed Mrs. Frizzell, with irrepressible irritation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a-tellin&rsquo; everybody as your husband
were a dark-haired man.&nbsp; I had to make out a story now about
your mother-in-law having red hair.&nbsp; P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps she
has?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
dead long ago, and so is his father.&nbsp; Oh, Mother, how can
you make up sich tales?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I had to say summat when they axed me.&nbsp; If I
were to say as I didn&rsquo;t know, they&rsquo;d be sure to guess
as things wasn&rsquo;t all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if&mdash;if Jim ever do come back?&rdquo; faltered
the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll not come back&mdash;put that out o&rsquo;
your head,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frizzell shortly.</p>
<p>The tears rolled down Susie&rsquo;s face, and her eyes
followed her mother&rsquo;s energetic figure as it moved about
the room.&nbsp; Once or twice she <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>opened her lips as though to speak,
but her courage failed her.&nbsp; Then, suddenly, the words burst
from her&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee pray agen him!&nbsp; I
can feel as you&rsquo;re wishin&rsquo; and wantin&rsquo; him not
to come back.&nbsp; P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps ye be a-prayin&rsquo;
as&mdash;as summat may happen.&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t,
don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis wicked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Frizzell turned quite pale.&nbsp; She came and stood at
the foot of Susie&rsquo;s bed, gazing at her so oddly that the
girl, who was by this time shaking with hysterical sobs, became
more and more unnerved and frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, don&rsquo;t take on so,&rdquo; said her mother
at last, and her voice sounded husky and strange.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
mid be better nor what I am, the Lard knows, though,
p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps, it bain&rsquo;t my own darter&rsquo;s place
to tell I so; but I&rsquo;ve not gone so far as to pray for evil
to fall on anybody, if that be what ye mean.&nbsp; I be a
Christian woman, however wicked I mid be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you wish it,&rdquo; sobbed Susan.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
know you wish it, Mother&mdash;you do wish as Jim were
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lay down,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frizzell, coming round
to the side of the bed, and forcing her patient back upon her
pillows.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lay down, and keep still, and don&rsquo;t
go upsettin&rsquo; yourself <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>and this poor innocent child.&nbsp;
Leave the Lard to judge of I, as I do leave Him to judge of
<i>he</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan was slowly recovering strength when one day a letter
arrived containing news so consoling and yet so tragic that her
heart very nearly broke.</p>
<p>Jim&mdash;her Jim&mdash;her husband, for as such, in spite of
her mother&rsquo;s protests, she continued to regard him, had
written to her on the eve of battle&mdash;a manly letter, full of
remorseful tenderness.&nbsp; Solemn thoughts had come to him out
there on the lonely veldt, face to face with death.&nbsp; The
remembrance of the innocent creature who had trusted him, and
whom he had loved and wronged, haunted him perpetually.&nbsp; The
conduct which had once seemed to him excusable now appeared to
him in its true light.&nbsp; Moreover, his actual rough life, the
hardships, the horrors of war, threw into stronger relief the
happy hours which he had passed by her side; his brief glimpses
of home&mdash;home of which pretty, guileless Susie had been the
presiding goddess.</p>
<p>So, when the great fight was imminent, he had bethought him of
writing to her, telling her a little of what was in his mind,
announcing that he loved her still, and if God spared him to
return he would do the right thing by her and make her his wife
in earnest.</p>

</div>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>But
alas! and alas! the letter was enclosed in one written by another
hand, and the poor soldier&rsquo;s own unfinished missive bore a
postscript of a sinister kind&mdash;a deep red-brown stain.</p>
<p>The writer of the enclosure&mdash;an ambulance-nurse, no
doubt&mdash;related how poor Jim had been so anxious for the
letter to be sent that she had despatched it as it was.&nbsp; At
his request the envelope bore Mrs. Frizzell&rsquo;s name, and for
her the enclosure was intended.&nbsp; Would she, the writer
asked, break to her daughter that Gunner Barton&rsquo;s wounds
were of so serious a nature that it was impossible he could
recover?&nbsp; He had been struck and fearfully shattered by some
fragments of a shell&mdash;in fact, by the time his letter
reached its destination he must be dead.</p>
<p>Martha was standing supporting herself by the table, and
vainly trying to muster up courage to face Susan, when a cry from
behind her made her start and look furtively round.&nbsp; There,
on the narrow stairs, stood the girl herself, her figure
unnaturally tall in its clinging white nightdress, her eyes
dilated, her pale lips apart.</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>Not a
word could the mother say.&nbsp; She stood clutching the papers
which fluttered in her hand.</p>
<p>But Susie had already seen that terrible smear, and again a
cry rang through the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother! oh, Mother! you&rsquo;ve done it!&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve got your wish&mdash;he&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Mrs. Frizzell, darting forward, was just in time to catch
her as she fell.</p>
<p>But a little later, after being carried back to bed with the
aid of Mrs. Cross&mdash;whom Martha prudently banished on the
first sign which Susie gave of &ldquo;coming to&rdquo;&mdash;the
poor girl wept as much with gladness as with grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did love me, Mother; you see how he did love me, and
he did mean to make amends.&nbsp; Thank God for that!&nbsp; Oh,
thank God for that!&nbsp; If he hadn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; wrote
you&rsquo;d never ha&rsquo; believed me; but I knew&mdash;I
knew!&nbsp; But now I shall never see his face no
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, pressing the letter to her heart, she turned and hid
her face upon the pillows, refusing to be comforted.</p>
<p>Mrs. Frizzell went downstairs and sank into the
elbow-chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lard forgive me!&rdquo; she said to herself over and
over again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good Lard, forgive me!&nbsp; I <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>can scarce
think I wished en dead, but I did wish for en not to come back,
and I did tell so many lies that they&rsquo;ve a-come true to
punish I.&nbsp; There, my child be a-breakin&rsquo; her heart,
and &rsquo;tis me as has done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By-and-bye Mrs. Cross peered in again, anxious and
curious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did make Susan take that bad turn, I
wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Frizzell, looking up with red
eyes, but with an odd sense of returning self-respect&mdash;this
time, at least, she was telling no untruth&mdash;&ldquo;it be
enough to upset her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ve a-had a letter from her
husband, wrote afore he died: so lovin&rsquo;.&nbsp; And it be
all stained wi&rsquo; blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear heart alive!&rdquo; groaned the other
sympathetically.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor Mr. Griggs!&nbsp; They took it
off en after he were dead, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Frizzell&rsquo;s face fell.&nbsp; It was hard, after all,
to persevere in the path of rectitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ees,&rdquo; she said faintly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Leastways, the nurse as sent it on said he were almost
gone when she took it off en.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah-h-h!&rdquo; groaned the neighbour again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, we do know he be dead, Mrs. Frizzell, don&rsquo;t
we? seein&rsquo; as his name were in the paper, and
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>&ldquo;Oh, &rsquo;ees,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Frizzell,
still more falteringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his blood was on the letter,&rdquo; resumed Mrs.
Cross, with a certain gruesome relish, though her eyes were full
of tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear, now, I should like to see it.&nbsp;
It &rsquo;ud be really summat to see, wouldn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but my poor Susan, she won&rsquo;t let nobody look
at it,&rdquo; returned the mother in quick alarm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ve a-got it under her pillow, and she&rsquo;ve
a-got fast hold on&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor young thing!&nbsp; Well, I can understand her
feelings&mdash;p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps some other
day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, don&rsquo;t think it, Mrs. Cross&mdash;don&rsquo;t
look for&rsquo;t!&nbsp; Says she to I, &lsquo;Mother, you
won&rsquo;t never let no stranger set eyes on this here.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas meant for nobody but me,&rsquo; says she, and I do
mean to keep it for myself.&rsquo; . . .&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s
another,&rdquo; lamented the poor woman almost in despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well, mum; I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t want
to put myself forrard where I bain&rsquo;t wanted,&rdquo;
retorted Mrs. Cross in a tone of offended dignity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I thought I mid make so bold as to ax, seein&rsquo; as
I&rsquo;ve a-knowed your Susan since she were no bigger than her
own blessed orphan child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, now, no offence.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t suppose, <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>Mrs. Cross,
as Susan &rsquo;ull so much as let Father see it.&nbsp; There
now, talkin&rsquo; of the baby, would you like to look at
en?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll fetch en in a minute; he be comin&rsquo; on
finely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t seen en for two or three
days&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t take much notice on en jist now when
Susan seemed so bad,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Cross, lingering in the
hope of picking up a further crumb or two of information.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ye don&rsquo;t seem to take much notice on en yourself, my
dear&mdash;I do scarcely ever see you nursin&rsquo;
en.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a-been so taken up with Susan, d&rsquo;ye
see,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frizzell, with a sudden pang of
remorse.</p>
<p>She went upstairs for the child, and after he had been duly
admired, and the visitor had withdrawn, she still sat looking
down at the little placid face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; she said to herself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Poor fellow!&nbsp; Ah! I fancy he&rsquo;d have been proud
if he&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; lived to come back an&rsquo; own ye,
Baby.&nbsp; Dear, dear! they mid all ha&rsquo; been so
happy&mdash;and all forgive an&rsquo; forgot.&nbsp; Ah! he were
sorry enough, poor chap, and he did repent&mdash;the Lard
&rsquo;ull ha&rsquo; mercy on him for that. . . .&nbsp;
&rsquo;Ees, I can fancy he&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been proud if he
could ha&rsquo; seen ye, Baby; but there, all of en as &rsquo;ull
ever <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>come
back is them few lovin&rsquo; words and that dreadful spot
o&rsquo; blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Mrs. Frizzell fell to weeping again for pure pity,
and kissed the little soft face of the dead soldier&rsquo;s child
and the tiny rings of ruddy gold which no father&rsquo;s hand
would ever stroke.</p>
<p>When John came in she conveyed the tidings to him in
half-inarticulate shouts, between bursts of sobbing.&nbsp; The
big dull man stood gazing at her for a moment in perturbed
amazement, and then went, slowly and heavily, upstairs.</p>
<p>Susan still lay with her face hidden, and her slight frame
heaving with convulsive sobs.</p>
<p>Her father paused in the doorway, and then came lumbering
forward towards the bed, stooping when he reached it and patting
the girl&rsquo;s shoulder with his great horny, toil-worn
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee take on, Susie, my dear,&rdquo;
he murmured, blubbering too, poor fellow.&nbsp; &ldquo;There,
don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee cry, Maidie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Father,&rdquo; moaned Susan, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
&rsquo;ee call me that&mdash;don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee never call me
that no more!&nbsp; I be a widow&mdash;I be a real widow
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, &rsquo;tis true,&rdquo; murmured poor Frizzell <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>indistinctly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye be a widow, my poor
maid&mdash;ye be a widow now, sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>But it was not so sure after all.&nbsp; As Mrs. Frizzell
sometimes said, the most wonderfullest things did certainly
happen in her family.&nbsp; Lo! no sooner was Private Griggs
decently, and, as she imagined, finally interred than Gunner
Barton took upon himself to return to life; and the complications
which ensued were so bewildering that even Mrs. Frizzell was
unable to cope with them.&nbsp; For, on the receipt of the letter
which announced that Jim, though so seriously injured that he
would be more or less of a cripple all his life, was indubitably
recovering, and would in fact be shortly shipped home, Susan,
hitherto so meek and broken, became utterly unmanageable.</p>
<p>She was about to set forth on some household errand when she
met the postman, who informed her that he had a letter for her
mother from abroad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to me,&rdquo; cried Susan quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis for Mrs. Frizzell,&rdquo; said the rural
messenger in surprise; but the girl, with a flaming face, had
already torn open the envelope.</p>
<p>In another moment she rent the air with strange cries and
shrieks of joy.</p>
<p><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>All the
inhabitants of the place came hastening forth to inquire the
reason of the outcry, and there beheld the relict of Private
Griggs, with her yellow hair streaming over her shoulders, and
her face alight with a very passion of rapture, trampling on her
widow&rsquo;s bonnet, and brokenly telling her baby that Daddy
was coming home.</p>
<p>Mrs. Frizzell rose to the emergency.&nbsp; Putting her arm
round her daughter, she propelled her gently towards the house,
without deigning to notice by word or look the importunate
crowd.</p>
<p>Presently she went out, closing the door after her, and
repossessed herself of the obnoxious bonnet, which a thoughtful
neighbour had rescued from the dust and set upon a gatepost.</p>
<p>Before she could re-enter the house one or two anxious
friends, who had been eagerly on the look-out for her from divers
points of ambush, emerged from their respective doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Summat very strange must have happened, Mrs. Frizzell,
I&rsquo;m sure, to make Susan behave as she did just now,&rdquo;
one said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I never did see nothing like it,&rdquo; chimed in
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a man as was a bit drinky-like throw
off his hat and tread on it, but never <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>a respectable young &rsquo;ooman,
same as Mrs. Griggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor thing didn&rsquo;t know what she was
a-doin&rsquo;,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Frizzell.&nbsp; &ldquo;There,
it be all so mixed up I do scarce know how to tell ye.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll know the right o&rsquo; things in a few days.&nbsp;
It do seem now as if we&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; made some mistake in
thinkin&rsquo; Susie was a widow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lard, now, you don&rsquo;t say so?&nbsp; Weren&rsquo;t
Private Griggs killed, then, after all?&nbsp; Why, we did
see&rsquo;s name in papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them papers do make mistakes, though,&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Cross.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did see oncet or twicet as they did say:
&lsquo;So-and-so, stated to be missin&rsquo;, is now found to be
dead,&rsquo; and t&rsquo;other way round.&nbsp; This here be
t&rsquo;other way round, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ees,&rdquo; groaned Mrs. Frizzell, passing her
band wearily over her brow.&nbsp; It was very much the other way
round; the whole world, as it seemed to her, had turned
completely topsy-turvy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, I don&rsquo;t wonder as poor Susan be half out of
her mind.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t look so very well pleased
yourself, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scarce do know what I feel.&nbsp; I scarce can think
it be true.&nbsp; If it <i>bain&rsquo;t</i> true, what&rsquo;s to
become o&rsquo; Susan?&nbsp; As you do say, Mrs. <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>Cross,
she&rsquo;s very near out o&rsquo; her mind now.&nbsp; And if it
<i>be</i> true&mdash;there, them as wrote did say as he were so
terrible bad he were bound to be crippled for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crippled!&rdquo; ejaculated both women together; and
they looked at the mother aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Cross, &ldquo;Susan &rsquo;ull
have en to keep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She exchanged a look of blank dismay with her companion; it
was plain that in the eyes of both the calamity originally
believed in&mdash;that of the honourable demise of Private
Griggs&mdash;was regarded as a much less serious misfortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when do ye think ye&rsquo;ll be likely to know for
certain, my dear?&rdquo; insinuated Mrs. Cross, with her head on
one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they be a-sending <i>somebody</i> home, they do
tell me, but whether it be Susan&rsquo;s husband or not I
can&rsquo;t say.&nbsp; I suppose we&rsquo;ll know as soon as he
gets to England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah-h-h, dear, it do seem a strange story, to be
sure.&nbsp; And very likely when you do see en ye&rsquo;ll find
as it bain&rsquo;t Private Griggs at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely indeed,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Frizzell, with
extraordinary warmth of manner, but with a sinking heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>How she
contrived to keep Susan from divulging the whole story to her
interested neighbours was a mystery known only to the indomitable
little mother herself; for the girl, in her excited state, was
for doing away at once with pretence and owning the truth to all
comers.&nbsp; It was lucky for both that the suspense was not of
long duration.&nbsp; A few weeks after receiving the astonishing
tidings of Jim Barton&rsquo;s resurrection came the news that he
had arrived in England, and that he had been actually sent to the
temporary hospital at the Artillery Barracks in Dorchester.</p>
<p>And so it came to pass that one day two women appeared in the
doorway of the ward in which Gunner Barton lay, and paused for a
moment as though in uncertainty.&nbsp; Then, with a stifled cry,
the younger of the two rushed forward, past the long line of
beds, where, propped on pillows, were to be seen many faces pale
and drawn with pain.&nbsp; By the side of one&mdash;the palest of
all, so pale indeed that had it not been for the red-brown eyes
and auburn hair it might have been called utterly
colourless&mdash;she paused and fell upon her knees.&nbsp; She
forgot that many curious eyes were bent upon her; she forgot that
she was an injured woman; and that Jim, who had <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>wronged her,
was so maimed and shattered as to be in truth a very wreck of a
man; she forgot everything but that he was there, and that he
loved her.&nbsp; And so, poor little soft foolish thing, she put
her arm about his neck and laid her face upon the pillow beside
his, and kissed him, and murmured incoherent words of tenderness
and joy.</p>
<p>And Jim&mdash;poor Jim, his broken frame was so weak, and his
heart so torn by gladness mingled with a piercing sorrow, that he
hid his face upon her shoulder and wept like a little child.</p>
<p>By-and-bye Susie, throwing back her shawl, disclosed the
sleeping face of the babe with a kind of shrinking pride; and
Jim, with his great gaunt frame still shaking with sobs, raised
himself on his one serviceable elbow and looked at him long and
earnestly, though his eyes were still dim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
to make all square for him and you, Susan; but &rsquo;tis
puzzlin&rsquo; to know what&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m just
fit for nothin&rsquo;, my girl; I&rsquo;ll never be fit to do a
hand&rsquo;s turn for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Frizzell, who
had been standing at the foot of the bed, wiping her eyes and
sniffing violently.&nbsp; <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ees, poor fellow, I can
see from here where they&rsquo;ve a-took off your leg.&nbsp; I
can see quite plain that it bain&rsquo;t aside of the other under
the clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susie did not hear her; her face was burning as she bent it
close to Jim&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not mind nothin&rsquo;, Jim,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be only too proud and glad to work
for &rsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;d be my pension of course,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re so young, Susie; you might do
better p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps&mdash;if &rsquo;tweren&rsquo;t for the
little chap here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thrust out his long, feeble hand and touched the
child&rsquo;s soft face, his own working with emotion the
while.&nbsp; Wife, and child, and home&mdash;all there within the
grasp of those weak hands.&nbsp; Could he give them up?&nbsp; And
yet to be a burden all his days to the trusting creature, of
whose ignorance he had already taken shameful advantage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Susie,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know
what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; she returned earnestly, &ldquo;I do know it
very well&mdash;I do ax but one thing, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s blessin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Susie; and
stretching out her hand she pressed to his lips the finger which
was encircled by the wedding-ring.</p>

<p><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>Mrs.
Frizzell returned in the evening alone, it having been arranged
that Susan was to remain in Dorchester until Jim was sufficiently
recovered for the marriage to take place.&nbsp; She looked very
worn and pale and tired as she turned in at her garden-gate, and
was anything but gratified to find the alert Mrs. Cross on the
watch for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, so you&rsquo;ve come back wi&rsquo;out

59</span>&rsquo;ee the truth, I do scarce know what I be
doin&rsquo;.&nbsp; It bain&rsquo;t what I did look for,
d&rsquo;ye see.&nbsp; The man himself&mdash;my daughter&rsquo;s
&rsquo;usband&mdash;he bain&rsquo;t the man I did take en
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye don&rsquo;t tell me so!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs.
Cross, with a dropping jaw.&nbsp; &ldquo;In what way be he
different, Martha?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Frizzell slowly, &ldquo;I
d&rsquo; &rsquo;low I did tell &rsquo;ee as my daughter&rsquo;s
&rsquo;usband were a dark man.&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s one thing
as I did make a mistake about&mdash;his hair be red, Mrs.
Cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red!&rdquo; repeated the other, with a gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ees, red,&rdquo; reiterated Mrs. Frizzell,
assuming a stolid expression.&nbsp; &ldquo;That be the colour on
it, Mrs. Cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am surprised.&nbsp; To be sure, the blessed
baby&rsquo;s hair&rsquo;s red, too&mdash;it be easy accounted for
now, bain&rsquo;t it? seein&rsquo; as Private Griggs&rsquo;s hair
be red.&nbsp; I wonder how you did come to make sich a mistake,
Mrs. Frizzell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder!&rdquo; said the poor woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
mind were fair muddled up, I do think, and I did get a lot
o&rsquo; queer notions in my head.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s another
thing now; his name bain&rsquo;t Griggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lard! you do give I quite a turn.&nbsp; <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>However did
you come to think it were?&nbsp; And what mid his name be, Mrs.
Frizzell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Frizzell opened her mouth, shut it again, and swallowed
down what seemed to be a very unpleasant morsel; finally she
said, fixing her impenetrable eyes upon her neighbour&rsquo;s
face&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name be Barton&mdash;Gunner James Barton.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Ees, that be the name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barton!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Cross, in utter
bewilderment; then, after a momentary pause, she
continued&mdash;&ldquo;It bain&rsquo;t so very like Griggs, be
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For once Mrs. Frizzell&rsquo;s lively imagination was at
fault; she had no explanation to offer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo;
she said feebly, &ldquo;it bain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>UP AT
THE &rsquo;LOTMENTS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Old</span> Joseph Frisby stood at his
garden gate one fine bright evening in early spring.&nbsp; A
dirty, disreputable-looking old vagabond was he, a frequenter of
the &ldquo;Pure Drop,&rdquo; &ldquo;The True Lovers&rsquo;
Knot,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Three Choughs,&rdquo; and every such
place of entertainment within reach of his tottering old
legs.&nbsp; This evening he was perforce sober, for he had not
possessed a penny that he could call his own for several months,
and the landlords of the above-named hostelries had unanimously
declined to give him credit.&nbsp; As he stooped over the rickety
gate, his lean bent old figure clad in a tattered linen coat that
had once been white, and nether garments of inconceivably ancient
and patched corduroy, he looked forlorn and miserable enough;
there was even a certain pathos in his unwashed, unshaven face,
and his small bleared eyes peered anxiously out of the network of
furrows which surrounded them.&nbsp; Every now and then he placed
his hand over his ear and <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>turned his head as though listening,
and by-and-by the long expected sound for which he had been
waiting made itself heard.</p>
<p>The back door of the neighbouring cottage closed with a bang,
and a man came quickly round the house and down the tiny flagged
path through the little garden, which was already bright with
primroses and double daisies, and opened a gate similar to that
on which Joseph was leaning.&nbsp; He was a wiry elderly man,
with a fresh-coloured face framed in iron-grey whiskers.&nbsp;
His garments were very much like those worn by Frisby, except
that they possessed the merit of being clean.&nbsp; He carried a
basketful of potatoes, and a spade and fork rested on his
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evenin&rsquo;, neighbour,&rdquo; said Joseph,
straightening himself, and looking eagerly at him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ye be goin&rsquo; up to the &rsquo;lotments, I d&rsquo;
&rsquo;low?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said the other, glancing round, but without
slackening his pace.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off to the
&rsquo;lotments&mdash;pretty late, too; I must hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay now, bide a bit; I want to speak to ye a minute,
Jim.&nbsp; Lard! I&rsquo;ve waited here nigh upon an
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, an&rsquo; did ye?&rdquo; said the man called Jim,
coming unwillingly back.</p>
<p><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>&ldquo;Aye.&nbsp; Ye see &rsquo;tis this way.&nbsp;
Neighbour Cross, I haven&rsquo;t touched a drap this three
months, very near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Han&rsquo;t ye?&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m glad
on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m teetottle myself, an&rsquo;
&rsquo;tis the only way to get along, I do believe.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m truly glad to hear ye han&rsquo;t had no drunks lately,
Joe.&nbsp; Now that ye say so I do call to mind noticin&rsquo;
that ye&rsquo;ve been a-walkin&rsquo; uncommon
straight&mdash;aye, &rsquo;tis quite a while since you was found
in a ditch, &rsquo;tis sure, and ye haven&rsquo;t been run in not
this year, I don&rsquo;t think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; agreed Joseph, with modest pride.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re quite right, Jim; I haven&rsquo;t been run in
this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, rubbing his hands slowly together, and eyeing the
well-filled basket of &ldquo;sets&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; help from the parish
now,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;else we couldn&rsquo;t make out at
all.&nbsp; My pore wife, ye see, she&rsquo;s reg&rsquo;lar
crippled, an&rsquo; not able to do nothin&rsquo;, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;m not fit for much&mdash;I&rsquo;m falterin&rsquo;,
neighbour, an&rsquo; farmers hereabouts has a bad opinion
o&rsquo; me for some raison or another&mdash;I can scarcely ever
get a day&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis very onfart&rsquo;nate for &rsquo;ee, Joe;
&rsquo;tis that.&nbsp; But yer luck will change very like.&nbsp;
<a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>We must
&rsquo;ope it will.&nbsp; Well, I must be gettin&rsquo;
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye be goin&rsquo; to plant yer taters,&rdquo; persisted
Joseph; and stretching out his lean old hand he took hold of the
basket.&nbsp; &ldquo;Them be real fine taters, neighbour;
chock-full of eyes.&nbsp; Lard! if I had but a few of these
I&rsquo;d soon plant my bit of garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t ye got none this year?&rdquo; inquired
Jim, visibly stiffening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a single one, an&rsquo; no cabbage neither.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m terribly badly off this year&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
however me an&rsquo; the poor body inside &rsquo;ll get on.&nbsp;
Not a bit o&rsquo; green stuff, an&rsquo; not a set to put in the
ground.&nbsp; Three-an&rsquo;-six a week is every penny we have
to look to, an&rsquo; ye may think it don&rsquo;t go very
far.&nbsp; Bread an&rsquo; tea, bread an&rsquo; tea, an&rsquo;
not so much as a drop o&rsquo; milk to&rsquo;t.&nbsp; My missus,
she&rsquo;s that cute along o&rsquo; me likin&rsquo; a drap now
and then, she wouldn&rsquo;t let the Union folk give it us in
money&mdash;we jest hev an order for half a pound o&rsquo; tea
once a week, an&rsquo; we takes out the rest in bread.&nbsp; Ah
dear! a body has to be clever to live on it, I can tell
&rsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, leered insinuatingly in his neighbour&rsquo;s face,
and finally murmured, still fingering the basket: &ldquo;If ye
was to let me have a few <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>of these now, neighbour, I could pay
ye back i&rsquo; th&rsquo; autumn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim dexterously twisted his property away from the trembling
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what ye&rsquo;re at!&rdquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, nay, Joe; I&rsquo;ve had enough o&rsquo;
your payin&rsquo; back.&nbsp; I know what that manes.&nbsp; You
an&rsquo; yer missus &rsquo;ud make yer dinner off &rsquo;em, if
ye didn&rsquo;t chop the lot for a drink straight off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; pleaded Joe, almost tearfully;
&ldquo;&rsquo;tis too bad to say such things, and take a pore
man&rsquo;s character away.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll gi&rsquo;e ye me
Bible oath&mdash;dang me, an&rsquo; everythin&rsquo;
reg&rsquo;lar by the Book&mdash;that I&rsquo;d put &rsquo;em
straight in the ground, Jim Cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t spare the taters, anyhow,&rdquo;
grumbled Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a pore man an&rsquo; have to
purvide for mysel&rsquo; an&rsquo; my family.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
sorry I can&rsquo;t obleege ye, but so &rsquo;tis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked off, leaving poor old Joe staring blankly after
him.</p>
<p>By and by a light quick tread was heard approaching from the
opposite direction, and a dapper-looking young fellow rounded the
corner of the lane, whistling to himself as he advanced.&nbsp;
He, too, carried a fork, and a half-filled sack was flung over
his shoulder.</p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; up to the &rsquo;lotments?&rdquo;
inquired Joseph falteringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve jest knocked off work, an&rsquo; am
goin&rsquo; up there for an hour or two before dark.&nbsp; Fine
evenin&rsquo;, Mr. Frisby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, sure,&rdquo; said Joseph.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve
got a grand sackful there, Jan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a big piece to fill up, Mr. Frisby.&nbsp; We
han&rsquo;t got above half enough o&rsquo; our own.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll have to buy some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got <i>one</i> to put in my bit
o&rsquo; ground,&rdquo; said Joseph impressively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do ye think of that, Jan Domeny?&nbsp; Not one; no,
nor not so much as a stalk o&rsquo; cabbage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now,&rdquo; said Jan, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis very sad,
that, Mr. Frisby.&nbsp; A sorrowful tale, indeed.&nbsp; May-hap
Parson &rsquo;ud help ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; returned Joseph lugubriously; &ldquo;we be
chapel folk, an&rsquo; Parson he says he han&rsquo;t got no faith
in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;tis terrible onfart&rsquo;nate for
&rsquo;ee, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; returned Mr. Domeny
unconcernedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But bad times can&rsquo;t laist for
ever.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s comfort in that, Mr. Frisby.&nbsp; The
Lard trumpets the wind to the sore lamb, as Scriptur&rsquo;
says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having delivered himself of this edifying aphorism, young Jan
Domeny hoisted his sack <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>a little higher up on his shoulder,
and strode on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They be all alike,&rdquo; muttered Joe to himself;
&ldquo;they be a stony-hearted lot.&nbsp; Not one among &rsquo;em
&rsquo;ud gi&rsquo;e a man a helpin&rsquo; hand.&nbsp; Dang
&rsquo;em all!&rdquo; cried Joe, and he thumped upon the
gate.</p>
<p>He turned and shuffled slowly towards the house, pushing open
the door.&nbsp; A little old woman was sitting, propped up by
pillows, in an armchair near the hearth.&nbsp; She was almost
crippled by rheumatism, yet managed in some inexplicable way to
preserve a tolerable appearance of neatness and cleanliness, both
in her own person and in such of her surroundings as came within
reach of her poor distorted fingers.&nbsp; The hearth was tidy,
for instance, and the kitchen utensils and crockery on the little
dresser behind her chair were bright and clean.&nbsp; It must be
supposed that her husband, who would have been much the better
for a share of her attention, kept himself systematically out of
reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she inquired, eagerly looking up as he
entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t a bit o&rsquo; use.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ll none o&rsquo; them do a thing for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Frisby sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, sit down <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>anyhow,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Supper&rsquo;s
ready, an&rsquo; the tea&rsquo;s drawed beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe shambled over and sat down.&nbsp; His wife, leaning
painfully forward in her chair, moved the little brown teapot
from the hob to the table, and then, stooping again with yet more
difficulty, took up a plateful of dry toast and proffered it to
the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I made ye that for
a bit of a change.&nbsp; The fire was burnin&rsquo; up so clear
an&rsquo; nice, I jest thought I&rsquo;d do it.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twill be a nice change for &rsquo;ee,
Joseph&mdash;&rsquo;twill sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke in a high quavering voice, peering anxiously the
while at her spouse.</p>
<p>He took a piece of toast and turned it over; then broke off a
bit and flung it on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis as hard as flint, woman,&rdquo; he said
indignantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where d&rsquo;ye think I can find teeth
to bite en?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay now, &rsquo;tis not so &rsquo;ard as that comes
to,&rdquo; urged she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can bite en, an&rsquo; I
han&rsquo;t got a single tooth left.&nbsp; Sop it in yer tea, do
&rsquo;ee now, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll slip down nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slip down, indeed!&nbsp; It &rsquo;ud want a bit
o&rsquo; butter, or a bit o&rsquo; graise for that.&nbsp; But
here us be&mdash;two old ancient folks as has lived in this
parish man an&rsquo; wife for fifty-two year, an&rsquo;
they&rsquo;ll not so much as gi&rsquo;e us a tater.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>&ldquo;Yes a tater &rsquo;ud be nice, sure,&rdquo;
quavered the old woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;It &rsquo;ud be very
nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or a bit o&rsquo; green stuff &rsquo;ud be nice,&rdquo;
went on Frisby emphatically.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could eat this bread
if they&rsquo;d gi&rsquo;e I a bit o&rsquo; green to put
to&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But no, &rsquo;tis &lsquo;<i>Go away</i>,
<i>I&rsquo;ve nothin&rsquo; for &rsquo;ee</i>&rsquo; all
round.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s every man an&rsquo; bwoy in the place
workin&rsquo; up at the &rsquo;lotments, gettin&rsquo; the taters
into the ground as fast as ever they can stick &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
If they was to gi&rsquo;e us half a dozen each they&rsquo;d never
miss it, an&rsquo; I could get my bit &rsquo;o ground planted
up.&nbsp; But no, they be all took up wi&rsquo;
theirselves&mdash;never a thought for we.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Frisby rubbed her shrivelled hands together, and
sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, &rsquo;tis hard,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
hard, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then silence fell between the old couple, and each
consumed their meagre fare without any great appearance of
appetite.</p>
<p>Presently Joseph set down his cup, pushed back his chair, and
stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where be goin&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked his wife
querulously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never seed such a fidget of a
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; up to the &rsquo;lotments,&rdquo;
he responded curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laive me a pail o&rsquo; water first, do, so as I can
be washin&rsquo; up.&nbsp; I reckoned ye&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; helped
<a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>me a bit
to-night&mdash;rheumatics is terrible bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph took up the pail without a word and went out; presently
an excruciating creaking and squeaking was heard as he turned the
rusty handle of the windlass.</p>
<p>After some time he hobbled back, the water splashing from the
overflowing bucket at every step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear! what a mess the man d&rsquo; make!&rdquo; groaned
Mrs. Frisby.&nbsp; &ldquo;Carry it studdy, for the Lard&rsquo;s
sake.&nbsp; Now sit down, do &rsquo;ee, an&rsquo; gi&rsquo;e me a
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, I&rsquo;m off,&rdquo; responded her lord in surly
tones; and in another moment the garden gate creaked on its
hinges, and his departing steps fell heavily on the lane
outside.</p>
<p>This somewhat circuitous path led first past a horse-pond,
then skirted the beautifully kept churchyard, with the ancient,
ivy-grown edifice in the centre.&nbsp; Then it darted off at an
abrupt angle, apparently to avoid encroaching on the farm
premises in the rear of the church, where the picturesque
building which had once been a tithe-barn was now devoted to
humbler purposes.&nbsp; The lane ceased at its junction with the
high road, but crossing the latter, and following the footpath
for a little <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>way, Joseph came to another lane which, after a few
hundred yards, became a steep ascent.</p>
<p>The blackthorn was still in flower here and there in the
hedges, which accounted, as the country folk would have said, for
the peculiarly keen and chilly quality of the evening blast; but
the twisted twigs of the more genial hawthorn were powdered, as
it were, with a delicate dust of green.&nbsp; Trailing tendrils
of honeysuckle were already in full leaf, and young saplings of
elder stretched out slender bare limbs tufted at the ends with
crimson.&nbsp; Downy catkins, moreover, on many a willow bough
gave further promise of the rapid approach of the &ldquo;Sweet
o&rsquo; the Year;&rdquo; and there were violets in the banks,
and here and there a patch of primroses; and a glory of
dandelions everywhere.</p>
<p>But poor old Joe Frisby, as he toiled painfully up the stony
incline, had no eye for any of these trivialities; his mind was
set upon more weighty matters&mdash;he was bent, indeed, upon
nothing less important than an appeal to the community at
large.&nbsp; Singly the neighbours had rejected and despised his
petition; taken collectively they might, for very shame&rsquo;s
sake, be moved to grant it.&nbsp; No man, as Joseph dimly felt,
likes his individual <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>generosity to be overmuch counted
upon; but a whole community&mdash;each member making quite sure
that his neighbour does as much as he&mdash;may sometimes be
persuaded to accede to a claim which all alike acknowledge.</p>
<p>Now voices fell upon his ear, accompanied by the sound of
spades at work.&nbsp; An opening in the hedge revealed a gate
towards which Joseph made his way.&nbsp; On the other side lay
the allotments; narrow strips of ground, most of which were
already broken up into brown ridges, while a few were still
encumbered with the lingering stalks of last year&rsquo;s
cabbages, or an untidy growth of weeds.&nbsp; On this propitious
evening the place seemed alive with men and women; some delving,
some hoeing, some cutting up the &ldquo;sets&rdquo;&mdash;not a
patch of ground but had its occupant.&nbsp; Every one was busy
and every one seemed merry.&nbsp; Jan Domeny, with coat flung off
and shirt-sleeves rolled high, was lustily chanting a
three-year-old music-hall ditty, which had just found its way to
Dorset.&nbsp; Further away the bent back of Jim Cross formed a
moving arch against the sky-line; a grandchild had joined him,
and was trotting along beside him carrying the basket of
potatoes.</p>
<p>Joseph stood leaning over the gate for a <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>little while,
his eyes travelling slowly from one group to another; after long
hesitation he passed in and walked deliberately up the grassy
track which divided two batches of the allotments.&nbsp; Many of
the workers looked up a moment with a word or nod of recognition,
and Joseph nodded back, paused as if to speak, hesitated, and
then went on.&nbsp; At last he reached the centre of the ground,
and there came to a halt.&nbsp; He took off his battered hat,
flourished it to attract attention, and began, pitching his
quavering voice as high as he could:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neighbours all, I&rsquo;ve summat to say to
&rsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; cried the man nearest to him,
straightening himself and staring.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s old
Joe Frisby turned Methody praicher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, he&rsquo;ve a-jined the Salvation Army,
sure,&rdquo; cried another, who was himself a regular subscriber
to the &ldquo;War Cry&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what he&rsquo;s after,&rdquo; muttered Jan,
working away very diligently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you take
no heed, none of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been countin&rsquo; of ye up,&rdquo; pursued
Joseph, leaning on his stick and looking nervously round.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here be twenty chaps workin&rsquo; in the &rsquo;lotments;
aye, twenty chaps, not reckonin&rsquo; women and childern,
an&rsquo; ye be <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>all puttin&rsquo; in taters.&nbsp; An&rsquo; here am I
wi&rsquo; my garden at home waitin&rsquo; to be planted,
an&rsquo; not a bit o&rsquo; seed to put in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I telled &rsquo;ee, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; muttered Jan
to his nearest neighbour.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knowed &rsquo;twas that
he was at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived among ye man and bwoy for seventy-five
year.&nbsp; Aye, an&rsquo; my wife an&rsquo; me has been wed
among ye fifty-two year.&nbsp; There she d&rsquo; sit at home
crippled, poor soul.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve nought in the world but
what parish gives us.&nbsp; Half a pound o&rsquo; tea a week,
an&rsquo; some bread.&nbsp; Bread an&rsquo; tea, neighbours,
bread an&rsquo; tea; &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t very satisfyin&rsquo; to
the innards.&nbsp; Me an&rsquo; my wife was never great folks for
mate, but we d&rsquo; like a tater to our dinner, or a bit
o&rsquo; green stuff.&nbsp; An&rsquo; so I&rsquo;ve a-bin
thinkin&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked round again, hesitatingly and pitifully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a mortal sight o&rsquo; taters as is here
among ye between one an&rsquo; another&mdash;aye, a mortal
lot.&nbsp; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low&rdquo;&mdash;again the pause and
the appealing glance&mdash;&ldquo;if every man &rsquo;ud spare me
a few like I&rsquo;d get two or three ranks made up without any
of ye bein&rsquo; at much loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bystanders looked at each other, then each man glanced
involuntarily at his own store.&nbsp; None of them were over well
endowed <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>with this world&rsquo;s goods, and the calculations of
each had been made to a nicety.&nbsp; Old Jim Cross continued to
work without turning his head, and Jan Domeny smiled somewhat
sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, ye see &rsquo;tis this way, Joseph,&rdquo; said a
large mild man, with an habitually puzzled expression of
countenance; &ldquo;we be pore folks, all on us; we&rsquo;ve a
many little mouths to feed, an&rsquo; not much to put in
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; An&rsquo; what wi&rsquo; prices goin&rsquo; up
an&rsquo; rent day a-comin&rsquo; round so often like, a
man&rsquo;s hand d&rsquo; seem to be always in his pocket,
an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s give, give, an&rsquo; pay, pay, ever
an&rsquo; always, d&rsquo;ye see?&nbsp; Now my taters,&rdquo; he
cast a calculating eye upon the half-filled sack at his feet,
&ldquo;they&rsquo;ll not go so far to make up three ranks for
ourselves, an&rsquo; three ranks is the least we can do
wi&rsquo;.&nbsp; Aye, wi&rsquo; a houseful of growin&rsquo;
childern taters d&rsquo; last&mdash;well, I mid say they lasses
next to no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hearers drew a long breath of relief.&nbsp; If
Ed&rsquo;ard Boyt, who was well known to be a poor man with a
long family, had been imprudently generous, what might not be
expected of other folks who might be supposed better able to
afford him assistance?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, &rsquo;tis very true what Ed&rsquo;ard says.&nbsp;
Charity d&rsquo; begin at home.&nbsp; It &rsquo;ud seem a bit <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>&rsquo;ard to
go a-buyin&rsquo; for oneself along of helpin&rsquo; a
neighbour,&rdquo; said somebody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low &rsquo;tis true,&rdquo;
agreed another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True enough, sure!&rdquo; chimed in a third.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We be sarry for &rsquo;ee,&rdquo; summed up a fourth;
&ldquo;aye, we be very sarry for &rsquo;ee, Joseph, but
&rsquo;tis the onfart&rsquo;nate natur&rsquo; o&rsquo; things as
pore folks d&rsquo; have to do the best they can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, amid a general chorus of regretful approval, spades were
plied, and backs were bent as before.</p>
<p>Joe shambled back to the gate again, and stood for some time
leaning over it and staring at the toilers.&nbsp; His face was
very red, and his loose irregular under-lip trembled.&nbsp; A few
furtive glances were cast in his direction, but no one spoke, and
after a time he turned and went down the lane again, his bent
form, clad in its shabby white coat, travelling slowly past gap
after gap in the hedge until it drifted out of the range of
vision of the workers.&nbsp; As he walked, however, his heart was
hot within him with rage and disappointment and a bitter sense of
injustice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll lave me to starve,&rdquo; he said to
himself; &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve a-lived among &rsquo;em for
seventy-five year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His sense of injury deepened each time that <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>he recalled
this fact, and he shook his head vengefully.</p>
<p>As he tottered on his resentment gradually suggested to him a
startling plan of action.&nbsp; He thought of it all the way down
the lane and across the road, and along by the tithe-barn and the
church, and by the time he came to the horse-pond his mind was
made up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man must live,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;If other
folks won&rsquo;t help en he must help hisself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a fine moon that night, and had any one been abroad
an hour or so after midnight, he would have marked a white shape
creeping slowly up the lane which led to the allotments, and
presently entering in at the gate already described, and moving
from one newly planted patch of ground to another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only three from Ed&rsquo;ard because he&rsquo;ve
a-spoke me fair,&rdquo; murmured Joseph to himself;
&ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll not take &rsquo;em altogether,
neither.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t lave the pore chap wi&rsquo; a
great gap in the rank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph dropped something carefully into the sack which he
carried over his arm, and then he drew together the disturbed
clods and patted them down.&nbsp; Then waddling along with his
legs across the drill he cautiously removed another
&ldquo;set,&rdquo; and then another.</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do for Ed&rsquo;ard,&rdquo; he
muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis for feedin&rsquo; the pore, so
the Lard&rsquo;ll make it up to en.&nbsp; Now, Jan, I&rsquo;ll
take a good few from &rsquo;ee, because ye be a danged
&rsquo;ard-&rsquo;arted chap.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t care
where I d&rsquo; take &rsquo;em, nor if it do make
gaps&mdash;nay, that I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;ve a-sowed,
an&rsquo; ye&rsquo;ve a-watered, so to speak, Jan, but I d&rsquo;
&rsquo;low that it&rsquo;ll sarve &rsquo;ee right if the Lard
don&rsquo;t give &rsquo;ee no increase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He unearthed the &ldquo;sets,&rdquo; taking every precaution,
however, to make the ground look undisturbed.&nbsp; He went the
rounds, in fact, till his sack was nearly full, and then beat a
retreat, carrying home his booty unobserved.</p>
<p>It chanced that Jim Cross, waking with the dawn, fancied he
heard the sound of a spade in the next garden.&nbsp; On his way
to work, a little later on, he observed that a goodly portion of
Joseph&rsquo;s patch of ground was indeed freshly dug up.&nbsp;
Joseph was standing by the gate as usual, and nodded affably as
his neighbour passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see ye&rsquo;ve a-bin diggin&rsquo;,&rdquo; remarked
Jim, pausing with a surprised expression.&nbsp; &ldquo;Looks as
if ye was a-gettin&rsquo; the ground ready for taters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, an&rsquo; maybe I am a-gettin&rsquo; the ground
ready for taters,&rdquo; returned Joseph warmly.&nbsp; <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>&ldquo;I puts
my trust where trust be due.&nbsp; My fellow-creatur&rsquo;s have
a-turned their backs on me, so I looks to the Lard.&nbsp;
Aye,&rdquo; repeated Joseph, turning up his eyes piously,
&ldquo;I looks to the Lard for &rsquo;elp, Jim Cross.&nbsp; The
Lard&rsquo;ll purvide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim was much impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put me trust in Providence,&rdquo; pursued
Joseph, peering at him cautiously out of the corner of his eye;
&ldquo;and to show as I&rsquo;ve a-put my trust in Providence,
I&rsquo;m a-gettin&rsquo; ready my bit o&rsquo; ground.&nbsp;
When the Lard sends me them taters, neighbour, he&rsquo;ll find I
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim looked hard at him, and Joseph folded his arms and looked
back steadily and mildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t bear &rsquo;ee no grudge, Jim,&rdquo; he
went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t bear nobody no grudge, but I
do put my trust in the Lard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim went on his way, scratching his head from time to time,
and casting back sundry furtive glances at his neighbour, who
suddenly appeared to him in a new and impressive light.</p>
<p>When he disappeared Joseph went back to his digging, his
countenance still wearing an expression of aggrieved
virtue.&nbsp; After much pondering on his own conduct, and the
circumstances which had led up to it, he had <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>come to look
upon himself rather in the light of a martyr, and to consider his
recent action not only justifiable, but in a certain sense
inspired.&nbsp; He was, therefore, scarcely surprised when, late
that evening, Jim Cross came up to him with a deprecating
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me an&rsquo; a few of &rsquo;em yonder have been
a-talkin&rsquo; about you, Joseph,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have ye?&rdquo; responded Joseph, with an air of lordly
unconcern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye.&nbsp; We was sayin&rsquo; it did seem a bit
&rsquo;ard to disapp&rsquo;int &rsquo;ee like, when you was so
trustful an&rsquo; patient, so we agreed as we&rsquo;d try
an&rsquo; spare &rsquo;ee a few &lsquo;sets&rsquo; between
us.&nbsp; As I did say, the Lard&rsquo;ll make it up to we;
an&rsquo; I d&rsquo; think He will, neighbour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will, sure,&rdquo; agreed Joseph solemnly, as he
held out his grimy hand for the basket which Jim respectfully
tendered him.</p>
<p>Next came Ed&rsquo;ard Boyt with a small, a very small bagful,
but a heart overflowing with good-will.&nbsp; Joseph thanked him
for his contribution almost with the air of one bestowing a
benediction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis very well done of &rsquo;ee, Ed&rsquo;ard;
an&rsquo; ye&rsquo;ll not be no loser.&nbsp; Nay, you&rsquo;ll
see how things &rsquo;ll turn out wi&rsquo; ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One after another they came, ending with <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>Jan Domeny,
whom Frisby received a little distantly, but on the whole
forgivingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis but a pore lot as ye&rsquo;ve brought me,
Jan.&nbsp; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low as Ed&rsquo;ard Boyt have done
better nor you.&nbsp; Aye, he&rsquo;ve done very well for he,
such a pore man as he be, an&rsquo; such a long fam&rsquo;ly as
he have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ve a-had to buy, Mr. Frisby,&rdquo;
returned Jan apologetically.&nbsp; &ldquo;But there, I&rsquo;ll
see if we can spare a few more, an&rsquo; fetch &rsquo;em round
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow &rsquo;ll do very well,&rdquo; agreed Joseph
generously; and so they parted.</p>
<p>Then Frisby fell to work with a joyful heart, setting out
first of all the potatoes which he had purloined, and which he
had originally designed to plant surreptitiously by night,
intending, when the first shoots made their appearance, to assure
his neighbours that they had sprung miraculously from the
ground.&nbsp; This was better: moreover the second edition of
&ldquo;sets&rdquo; was much larger than the first, and he now
found himself in a position to stock his entire garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lard &rsquo;elps them as &rsquo;elps
theirselves,&rdquo; he said to himself once more, as he waded
solemnly up and down the drills.</p>
<p>From that day forward Joseph Frisby was <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>respected by
all the village folk.&nbsp; He had &ldquo;got religion,&rdquo; to
begin with&mdash;more religion than anybody had credited him
with, and he had evidently been singled out by Heaven for special
favours.&nbsp; His crop prospered wonderfully; people were quite
amazed to see the marvellous return made by their contributions,
and were the more astonished because other small producers had
not found it such a very good year for taters.&nbsp; There were
many gaps among the ranks at the allotments, and it was
noticeable that Jan Domeny, in particular, had suffered
severely.</p>
<p>No one was more loud in commiserating this misfortune than
Joseph Frisby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ways of Providence be wonderful, as the
Scriptur&rsquo;s say, Jan Domeny,&rdquo; he remarked one
day.&nbsp; &ldquo;Aye, &rsquo;tis what I often d&rsquo; say to
myself: a man may plant and a man may water, but &rsquo;tis the
Lard as gives the increase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Jan, a little grudgingly,
&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low that He&rsquo;ve a-gi&rsquo;ed it to
you, Mr. Frisby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He have, Jan; He have!&rdquo; agreed Joseph
heartily.</p>
<h2><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>&ldquo;THE ONLY SOLDIER.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">little</span> group of houses nestling
in the hollow near the church, about half a mile from the village
proper; all with tiled roofs more or less the worse for wear, and
in consequence highly picturesque, tiny patches of flower-garden
in front, and larger strips, devoted to vegetables, in the
rear.&nbsp; Some of these cottages stood back to back, others
retired a little from their fellows, and one shot out at a bold
angle from its neighbour with a certain independent air which was
increased by the rakish poise of its somewhat dilapidated
chimney.</p>
<p>As the hands of the ancient grandfather&rsquo;s clock in this
last-named dwelling-house approached the hour of noon, a short,
spare, elderly woman threw open the door and took up her position
on the carefully whitened step.&nbsp; She looked expectantly up
the road in the direction of the village, and of the town
beyond.</p>
<p>Presently another couple of doors were <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>thrown back,
and two additional figures&mdash;the figures of Mrs.
Stuckhey&rsquo;s nearest neighbours&mdash;also emerged into the
open and cast glances of anticipation in the same direction.</p>
<p>The coincidence seemed to strike one of the party, a fat woman
with a good-humoured face and untidy wisps of greyish hair
escaping from the control of the solitary and crooked brass
hairpin which was supposed to keep them in their place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We be all on the look-out, we mid say,&rdquo; she
remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I be awaitin&rsquo; for the
childern.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis time they were home from school.&nbsp;
I have to send David on a message before he goes back after
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son d&rsquo; seen to be a bit late too,&rdquo;
chimed in the lady whose doorstep was parallel to that of the
last speaker; a somewhat vixenish-looking person this, with a
pinched and pointed nose, and a sour mouth that seldom
smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;He be kept awful busy up at the line,&rdquo;
she continued fretfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;He do seem to work twice so
hard as he did since that there old war began.&nbsp; I d&rsquo;
wish it was ended, that I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more than you wishes that, Mrs.
Woolridge,&rdquo; said the owner of the independent house,
folding her arms and holding up her head with a certain
assumption of dignity.&nbsp; <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>&ldquo;Them that has friends out
there&mdash;them that has <i>sons</i> out there, they be the
folks as wish the war was well over; and they do do it, Mrs.
Woolridge&mdash;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low they do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; so they may,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Woolridge
acidly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t think what ever
makes folks go to be soldiers!&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t have my son
a soldier&mdash;no, not if he was to go down on his bended knees
I wouldn&rsquo;t agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t go so far as that,&rdquo; returned
Mrs. Stuckhey.&nbsp; &ldquo;It d&rsquo; seem a bit hard, I
d&rsquo; &rsquo;low, to part wi&rsquo; &rsquo;em; but &rsquo;tis
a fine thing for to serve Queen and country, and I d&rsquo; feel
so to speak proud o&rsquo; my Joe.&nbsp; E-es, I mid say I am
proud of him!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s summat, after all, to think as
he&rsquo;s the only soldier in the place&mdash;the only soldier
in Riverton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; a good job too,&rdquo; retorted Mrs.
Woolridge; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad there bain&rsquo;t no more on
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; If there wasn&rsquo;t no soldiers there
wouldn&rsquo;t be no wars; and to my mind wars is wicked
things&mdash;reg&rsquo;lar flying in the face o&rsquo;
Providence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, now,&rdquo; put in good-natured Mrs. Blanchard,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure everybody, high and low, the gentry and
sich as we together, all d&rsquo; seem to think the world
o&rsquo; the soldiers.&nbsp; And it be quite natural as you
should feel a bit <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>proud, Mrs. Stuckhey, my dear, seeing as your son is the
only soldier as comes fro&rsquo; this here village.&nbsp; Why, we
was a-prayin&rsquo; for the soldiers to-week, Mrs. Woolridge, so
I can&rsquo;t think as war can be anyways wicked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;E-es, indeed,&rdquo; agreed Susan Stuckhey, addressing
herself pointedly to the last speaker, for she had been somewhat
hurt by Mrs. Woolridge&rsquo;s remarks.&nbsp; &ldquo;I d&rsquo;
&rsquo;low I could very near ha&rsquo; cried o&rsquo; Sunday,
when the service was gi&rsquo;ed out for the soldiers,
seein&rsquo; as all the prayers in this place was a-goin&rsquo;
up for my Joe.&nbsp; I went round to the rectory afterwards, and
I did thank the Reverend.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis very kind
o&rsquo; ye, I&rsquo;m sure, sir,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;to take
so much trouble for my son.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What trouble,
Susan?&rsquo; says he, looking a bit dazy like.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,
the service, sir,&rsquo; says I.&nbsp; &lsquo;All the long
prayers, and the collect, and all&mdash;for our soldiers, you
know.&nbsp; My Joe be the only soldier from
Riverton.&rsquo;&nbsp; So now when he do meet me he do
al&rsquo;ays ax, &lsquo;Any noos, Susan, from our only
soldier?&rsquo;&nbsp; That reminds me, postman be late to-day,
bain&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; The mail do come in from abroad to-day,
d&rsquo;ye see, and I&rsquo;m on the look-out for a
letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Blanchard and Mrs. Stuckhey craned their heads once more,
peering anxiously up <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>the road; but Mrs. Woolridge remained
ostentatiously immovable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that was what fetched you out,&rdquo; she
remarked ungraciously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll
&rsquo;low as postmen be o&rsquo; some use.&nbsp; It d&rsquo;
seem to me as they d&rsquo; serve their country just so well as
soldiers; and there&rsquo;s others as serves their country
too.&nbsp; I reckon as my son Robert d&rsquo; serve his country
better nor any soldier.&nbsp; What &rsquo;ud the country do
wi&rsquo;out trains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Stuckhey smiled pityingly, and replied in a tone of
dignified amusement, &ldquo;They be useful too, no doubt, in
their way; but ye&rsquo;ll hear different to your notion, Mrs.
Woolridge.&nbsp; &lsquo;Soldiers of the Queen,&rsquo; you know:
they stand high, d&rsquo;ye see&mdash;more partic&rsquo;lar jest
now.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your country&rsquo;s love to
you!&rsquo;&mdash;nobody wouldn&rsquo;t go for to say that to a
postman, would they now? nor yet to a man what was workin&rsquo;
on the line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; agreed Mrs.
Blanchard.</p>
<p>Mrs. Woolridge tossed her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think there&rsquo;s a deal too much fuss made
about them soldiers,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;not
meanin&rsquo; your son in partic&rsquo;lar, Mrs. Stuckhey, but
the lot of &rsquo;em; and I can&rsquo;t think as the Lard&rsquo;s
blessin&rsquo; can rest on this here war.&nbsp; <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>It d&rsquo;
stand to reason as it can&rsquo;t&mdash;sendin&rsquo; up the
price o&rsquo; everythin&rsquo;, and makin&rsquo; it so hard for
the poor to live.&nbsp; Why, the very price o&rsquo; coal be
doubled very near.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell me as the
A&rsquo;mighty can approve o&rsquo; that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A faint colour overspread the sallow cheek of the
soldier&rsquo;s mother, and there is no knowing how severe might
have been her retort had not the long-expected form of the
one-armed postman chanced to round the corner at this juncture,
escorted by some five or six juvenile Blanchards.</p>
<p>As he drew near he was observed to fumble in his bag, and
presently halted before the group of matrons, his face wreathed
with smiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got summat for &rsquo;ee to-day, Mrs.
Stuckhey.&nbsp; Noos fro&rsquo; the front; a letter fro&rsquo;
the soldier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Susan, and her small black eyes
twinkled as she thrust forward an eager hand.</p>
<p>The postman detached one letter from the packet which he drew
forth from his bag, and, after it had passed from his possession,
proceeded to tighten the string which was tied round the
remainder, his teeth coming very deftly to the assistance of his
fingers.</p>
<p><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>&ldquo;He be with Buller, bain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; he
inquired, casting a sidelong glance at the mother as she hastily
unfastened the envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;E-es, he&rsquo;s wi&rsquo; <i>Mr.</i> Buller,&rdquo;
corrected Mrs. Stuckhey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Buller!&nbsp; Be that what ye d&rsquo; call
him?&rdquo; and the postman&rsquo;s keen eyes twinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it do seem more respectful like for I.&nbsp; Joe,
he do say the General; but it seems more natural for me to say
Mr. Buller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was Lord Buller,&rdquo; observed Mrs.
Blanchard doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind; Buller&rsquo;s enough for I,&rdquo;
said the postman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Does your son chance to say if
they&rsquo;re pretty near Ladysmith now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His much-frayed string seemed somewhat knotted, and
opportunities of hearing news direct from the front were
sufficiently rare to justify a little extra care in disentangling
it.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stuckhey drew forth and unfolded the missive, and her
audience duly composed themselves.&nbsp; Even Mrs. Woolridge was
conscious of a certain unwilling interest which she endeavoured
to disguise by an attitude of indifference&mdash;head thrown
back, nose screwed up, hands planted negligently on hips.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>&ldquo;My dear Mother,&rdquo; read Mrs. Stuckhey,
&ldquo;It is with the greatest of pleasure that I write these few
lines hoping you are well as it leaves me at present.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was merely the formula by which Soldier Joe, who was a
person of some education, considered it necessary to inaugurate
his letters; and the information which it ostensibly conveyed was
not intended to be taken literally, as was proved by the fact
that on one occasion this conventional statement had been
immediately followed by the announcement that he was wounded and
in hospital.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have got Back to the front Again and we
are going to make another start for Ladysmith before
long.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought they was close to Ladysmith by
now,&rdquo; interrupted the postman.&nbsp; &ldquo;The papers said
yesterday they was but eight mile away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you can&rsquo;t trust them papers,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Blanchard in a tone of conviction.&nbsp; &ldquo;They do
exaggerate, them papers; they just prints a lot o&rsquo; lies in
&rsquo;em to make &rsquo;em sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very like your son have made a mistake,&rdquo; observed
Mrs. Woolridge loftily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Joe, he&rsquo;s but
young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it stands to reason as them that&rsquo;s on the
spot must know better what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on nor <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>them
that&rsquo;s miles an&rsquo; miles away,&rdquo; retorted Mrs.
Stuckhey with some heat.&nbsp; &ldquo;This here noos comes
direct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did not seem to occur to any one that the tidings in
question were three weeks old.</p>
<p>She fell to the reading of her letter again, spelling out the
words slowly, and running the sentences one into another; indeed
it might have been a little difficult to do otherwise, for Joe
used capital letters impartially, and absolutely disdained
stops.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You may bet there won&rsquo;t be no turning
Back this time I hope you are saving the Papers for me and I hope
when Ladysmith is Relieved you will hang out a Flag and give us
Three cheers we deserve it I can Tell you dear Mother when the
bullets are whistling round you it is not exactly Pleasant but
they don&rsquo;t like the cold Steel and I hope we shall get near
enough to give them that I should like a Dig at the man what shot
me give my best Love to Maria and Jane I Fancy you was all
thinking of me on Christmas day I hope you had Roast beef and
enjoyed yourselves we had only a Dirty old stew in hospital it
will be a Good day when I come home you must have a Ox ready and
as many spuds as would grow in the garden for two or three years
dear Mother I think there is no more this time give my love to
all friends and don&rsquo;t Forget the Flag.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;From your loving son,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Joseph
Stuckhey</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; commented the mother, wiping her eyes,
&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low we did think o&rsquo; him on
Christmas Day.&nbsp; Maria&mdash;that&rsquo;s my maid
what&rsquo;s in service at Bourne&mdash;she were here for her
holiday; and Jane, my married daughter, you know, she come over
wi&rsquo; her husband and childern.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d ha&rsquo;
been a merry party if Joe&rsquo;d been here; but we did talk of
him a&rsquo;most wi&rsquo; every mouthful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The postman finished tying the last knot, and slung his bag
round under his empty sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be getting on,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; He would
repeat items from Joe Stuckhey&rsquo;s letter in the various
villages through which he passed in making his round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to be sure, &rsquo;tis nice to hear
direct,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Blanchard, slowly backing into her
house, and almost tumbling over two of three of her offspring as
she did so.</p>
<p>Mrs. Woolridge sniffed, scratched her elbows with an absent
air, cast another frowning glance up the road, and finding her
son was not in sight betook herself indoors.</p>
<p>The soldier&rsquo;s mother went in too, sat down to her
dinner&mdash;a cold one, for, being a washerwoman by profession,
Monday was a busy day with her, and she would not waste time <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>even in
boiling herself a &ldquo;spud&rdquo; or two.&nbsp; She spread out
Joe&rsquo;s letter on the table and meditated over it while she
ate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a flag,&rdquo; she said to
herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;E-es, I must get a little flag.&nbsp; And
when my Joe do come back he shall have as good a bit of roast
beef as I can buy, bless him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she went about her work that day her gaze wandered, even
more frequently than usual, to Joe&rsquo;s portrait, which hung
in a prominent position over the mantelpiece.&nbsp; This work of
art had been presented by the young soldier to his mother soon
after he had enlisted.&nbsp; He had not spared expense, and the
result, though somewhat wooden in attitude and uneasy in
expression, was eminently satisfactory to her.</p>
<p>While she wrung out her clothes or hung them on the line she
crooned to herself the refrain of the popular ditty, &ldquo;Tommy
Atkins,&rdquo; altering the name of the hero to suit her own
taste:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh-h, Joey, Joey Stuckhey,<br />
You&rsquo;re a good one, heart and hand,<br />
You&rsquo;re a credit to your country,<br />
And to all your native land.<br />
May your luck be never-failing,<br />
May your love be ever true&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>&ldquo;And that it will, I&rsquo;ll be bound; there
never were a more lovin&rsquo; lad.&nbsp; How he did hug I, to be
sure, afore he left last time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be observed that Susan&rsquo;s reading of the line was
not quite the same as that intended by the author of the
song.&nbsp; She wiped her eyes, sighed, and resumed with renewed
energy:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;May your luck be never-failing,<br />
May your love be ever true.<br />
God bless you, Joey Stuckhey,<br />
Here&rsquo;s your country&rsquo;s lo-o-o-o-ve to you!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She threw so much expression into the last line that the word
<i>love</i> expanded into a polysyllable.</p>
<p>A few days later news flew round the parish that Ladysmith had
actually been relieved; the authority vouched for being no less
than that of her Majesty the Queen.&nbsp; The baker brought the
news to Riverton.&nbsp; His eyes appeared ready to jump from his
head with excitement as he made the announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be hearin&rsquo; bells a-ringin&rsquo;
to-night,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, they be runnin&rsquo;
up flags all over the place a&rsquo;ready.&nbsp; And they do say
as they be a-goin&rsquo; to &rsquo;luminate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flags!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Stuckhey.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
must get a flag at once.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll start so soon as <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>I&rsquo;ve
a-had my tea.&nbsp; I wish I&rsquo;d a-got it afore; but my
son&mdash;him that&rsquo;s the only soldier here, you know,
baker&mdash;he did say when he last wrote as they was but
startin&rsquo; to relieve Ladysmith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can scarce believe as the noos be true,&rdquo;
observed pessimistic Mrs. Woolridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t be in too great a hurry to get that flag if I was
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should think the Queen ought to know,&rdquo;
retorted her neighbour with spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
a-goin&rsquo; to get it, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go along with &rsquo;ee, my dear,&rdquo;
cried Mrs. Blanchard, who was always ready for an outing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford no flags myself, but I&rsquo;m sure I
wish &rsquo;ee well, an&rsquo; am pleased at your son&rsquo;s
success.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve only got to give the childern their
tea, and clean me a bit, and put on bonnet and shawl, and
I&rsquo;ll be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The baker&rsquo;s cart jolted away and the two women hastened
indoors.&nbsp; It took Mrs. Blanchard some time to complete her
preparations, and it was past six o&rsquo;clock by the time they
reached the little town.</p>
<p>The market-place presented an unusually gay appearance:
bunting floated from the church tower, the Corn Exchange, and all
the principal buildings; rows of light were already <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>appearing in
many of the windows; groups of people stood about, laughing,
talking, singing; many of them cheered as newcomers arrived upon
the scene and were told the news.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stuckhey and her friend, having purchased the flag,
attached themselves to one of the groups in question, and heard
how the tidings had first come &ldquo;down the line,&rdquo; and
how, subsequently, a telegram had arrived at the Royal
George.&nbsp; Mrs. Stuckhey was in the act of expatiating on the
information conveyed in her son&rsquo;s letter when, with a
mighty clang, the bells rang out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re at it,&rdquo; cried a man, detaching
himself from the knot of people the better to flourish his
hat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Three cheers for Buller and White.&nbsp;
Hip&mdash;hip&mdash;hip&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurray!&rdquo; roared the crowd.</p>
<p>Cling, cling, clang! chimed the bells.</p>
<p>Then all at once, no one knew how, the merry-making ceased,
the cheerful jangling came to an end, the ringers loosing the
ropes so suddenly that the bells continued to swing for some
little time longer, sending forth occasional slow faint notes of
most funereal sound.&nbsp; As anxious glances sought the church
tower the flag was seen to have disappeared; moreover, it was
observed that the kindred <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>trophy which had proudly surmounted
the Corn Exchange was being hauled down.&nbsp; What had
happened&mdash;what was wrong?</p>
<p>The disappointing news soon flew from mouth to mouth: it was
all a mistake.&nbsp; Ladysmith was not relieved after all.&nbsp;
Someone had just telegraphed from London to say that there was no
foundation for the report.&nbsp; The War Office had, in fact,
declared it to be false.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis my belief as that there War Office
don&rsquo;t know so very much,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Stuckhey,
indignant in her disappointment.&nbsp; &ldquo;When my son Joe was
wounded they did send me a very nice letter, to be
sure&mdash;Lord Lansdowne I believe it was from, and a beautiful
hand his lordship do write&mdash;but he didn&rsquo;t tell I
nothin&rsquo; about it&mdash;not whether &rsquo;twas in his arm,
or leg, or nowhere in partic&rsquo;lar.&nbsp; So there, I just
sent him a telegraft to ax how my son were, and he never took no
notice.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee tell I as he knows
what&rsquo;s going forrard better nor the Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but they do say now as the Queen didn&rsquo;t say
nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said somebody ruefully.</p>
<p>The lights were being blown out, the flags removed; people
were returning homewards.&nbsp; Mrs. Stuckhey, still unconvinced
and irate, <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>was constrained to follow their example, clutching her
little sixpenny flag in its paper wrapper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lard! how awful molloncolly that there bell do
sound,&rdquo; groaned Mrs. Blanchard dolefully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dear, to be sure, a body mid think as it were
tollin&rsquo; for a funeral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, my dear, don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee talk so
foolish,&rdquo; responded Susan with some acerbity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis but the ringers as has left the ropes
a-swingin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I should be ashamed, Mary Blanchard, to
go a-givin&rsquo; way like that, and you with all them childern,
as ought to know better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be that nervish, d&rsquo;ye see.&nbsp; Lard, I do
feel shaky all over.&nbsp; I have a kind o&rsquo; porsentiment as
summat have a-happened&mdash;that I have, and I can&rsquo;t say
no different, Mrs. Stuckhey, not if it be to please
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the pair were overtaken by a stout, elderly
man, who, recognising them as he passed, turned to greet the
person whom the news might be supposed to concern most
nearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evenin&rsquo; to &rsquo;ee, Mrs. Stuckhey; this
here be very disapp&rsquo;intin&rsquo;, bain&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan responded with a little &ldquo;dip,&rdquo; for Farmer
Joyce was the principal inhabitant of Riverton.</p>
<p><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>&ldquo;E-es, sir, it be a bit disapp&rsquo;intin&rsquo;,
I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low, but I reckon we&rsquo;ll be hearin&rsquo;
to-morrow as the good noos be true, and &rsquo;tis but the War
Office what have made a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; returned the farmer,
heaving a deep sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Them there Boers be a queer
lot.&nbsp; I did never hear tell o&rsquo; sich folks.&nbsp; They
do seem to be here, there, and everywhere, all at once as mid
be&mdash;poppin&rsquo; up jist same as rabbits in warren.&nbsp;
Ah,&rdquo; he cried, delighted with his own simile, and anxious
if possible to improve it, &ldquo;it be jist same as if our
troops were a-fightin&rsquo; o&rsquo; rabbits&mdash;rabbits
wi&rsquo; guns,&rdquo; he added with a chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my son do say as they don&rsquo;t like the cold
steel,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Stuckhey cautiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
son didn&rsquo;t seem noways afeared on &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Says he,
when he did last write, says he, &lsquo;I should like a dig at
the man what shot me&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, and did he?&rdquo; said Mr. Joyce much
impressed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well now, that was a good
sayin&rsquo;.&nbsp; A dig!&nbsp; Haw, haw?&rdquo; here the farmer
came to a standstill in the road to laugh more at his ease.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;d like to give him a dig, would he?&mdash;haw,
haw!&mdash;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low he would.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis
but nat&rsquo;ral, d&rsquo;ye see, Mrs. Stuckhey,&rdquo; he
continued more seriously as he rolled forward again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nobody couldn&rsquo;t blame <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>the chap for wishin&rsquo; to stick
the man as put a bullet in en&mdash;they couldn&rsquo;t,
indeed.&nbsp; Ye can&rsquo;t expect a soldier to turn the other
cheek, can ye now?&nbsp; But them Boers be jist same as
rabbits&mdash;&rsquo;tis what I do say constant.&nbsp; But
we&rsquo;ll ferret &rsquo;em out, yet&mdash;haw, haw,
haw!&mdash;we&rsquo;ll ferret &rsquo;em out, won&rsquo;t
us?&nbsp; Good-night to &rsquo;ee, Mrs. Stuckhey, and good-night
to you, Mrs. Blanchard.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll be a-lookin&rsquo; for
good noos soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the next war-news which came to Riverton was tragic.&nbsp;
To the country at large, indeed, the glorious capture of
Hlangwane Hill was a triumph, but among the killed on that day
chanced to be Private Joseph Stuckhey, Riverton&rsquo;s only
soldier.</p>
<p>The blinds were drawn down in his mother&rsquo;s little
cottage, and friends and neighbours went in and out with dolorous
faces.&nbsp; Who shall tell how the tidings were first broken to
her, the faltering incredulous words she said, her bewildered
grief?</p>
<p>A day or two after her home was made desolate Farmer Joyce,
standing by his gate, happened to see her returning from the
town, accompanied by Mrs. Blanchard, both of them burdened with a
multiplicity of small parcels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, greeting her with a groan of <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>sympathy,
&ldquo;ye&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; been gettin&rsquo; o&rsquo; your
deep Mrs. Stuckhey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;E-es, sir, I did have a few little things to get afore
Sunday.&nbsp; There weren&rsquo;t no sich hurry as usual when
there be a death in th&rsquo; family&mdash;no funeral, you
know.&nbsp; Dear, to be sure, it do seem so strange to think as
there bain&rsquo;t no funeral!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis what d&rsquo;
seem to come harder nor anything.&nbsp; If there were but a grave
as I could &rsquo;tend to: if I could but ha&rsquo; done his
last, Mr. Joyce.&nbsp; If it had but pleased the Lard to
ha&rsquo; took him from me in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, now, don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee take on, Mrs.
Stuckhey.&nbsp; They do say as the poor dead bodies be treated
wonderful respectful abroad.&nbsp; E-es, they do say so, indeed;
and if your son had a-died in England somewhere up the country as
where his reg&rsquo;ment mid be, you couldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo;
done his last for en no more nor you can now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
a-been told as there be some graveyards, Mrs. Stuckhey&mdash;and
not so far away neither&mdash;as be just same as rabbit warrens;
you wouldn&rsquo;t never think there was no co&rsquo;pses in them
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, now, to think of that!&rdquo; ejaculated Susan,
almost forgetting her grief in her scandalised amazement.</p>
<p><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>&ldquo;E-es, indeed, they telled I that.&nbsp; Things
mid be worse, ye see.&nbsp; Not but what I do sympathise for
&rsquo;ee, Mrs. Stuckhey.&nbsp; It be a terrible
visitation&mdash;an&rsquo; you a lone woman, and him your only
son&mdash;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low it be a terrible
visitation.&nbsp; There bain&rsquo;t a single person in Riverton
village as don&rsquo;t feel for &rsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah-h-h, &rsquo;tis true, sir, &rsquo;tis true,&rdquo;
put in Mrs. Blanchard, shaking her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;There do
seem to ha&rsquo; comed quite a gloom over the place since the
sad noos come.&nbsp; E-es, I may say so, quite a gloom.&nbsp; And
us as was all rej&rsquo;ycin&rsquo; such a few days ago about
Ladysmith, you know, as weren&rsquo;t relieved at all.&nbsp;
Dear, yes, how well I do mind it.&nbsp; I did say then,
didn&rsquo;t I, Mrs. Stuckhey? as bell sounded just same as if
&rsquo;twere a-tollin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Them was my very words, and I
did go all shivery down my back and feeled quite nervish.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas a token, I do r&rsquo;aly believe.&nbsp; There was
bell a-tollin&rsquo; o&rsquo; Wednesday as &rsquo;twere Monday
poor Joe was killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, dear, &rsquo;tis that what comes most cruel hard of
all,&rdquo; groaned the poor mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was I
laughin&rsquo; and talkin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; the rest, and my poor
Joe stiff an&rsquo; cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;E-es, indeed, Mrs. Stuckhey,&rdquo; returned the
farmer, winking away a tear from his own <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>kindly
eyes, &ldquo;it do seem hard, I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low; the ways
o&rsquo; Providence be oncomprehensible, as the Bible do
say.&nbsp; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low, this here do seem very
providential.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; minded so much
if he&rsquo;d a-been struck down after they&rsquo;d won the
victory, d&rsquo;ye see,&rdquo; went on Susan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay,
I could ha&rsquo; bore it better&mdash;I could have felt as his
life weren&rsquo;t took for nothin&rsquo;; but to think as he
were cut off when they&rsquo;d only just started as he did tell I
in his last letter.&nbsp; That they took en and shot en and
&rsquo;tweren&rsquo;t no use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, now, don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee say that, Mrs.
Stuckhey, don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee go for to say that.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And Farmer Joyce brought down his fist emphatically on the low
wall near which he was standing.&nbsp; &ldquo;He gave his life
for summat, you may depend.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas in doin&rsquo; good
work as he fell; and that there work ull go on, and ull end well,
and your son ull ha&rsquo; helped to make it end well.&nbsp; Now,
see here, this be the way to look at it.&nbsp; A wall&rsquo;s a
wall, bain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;&nbsp; And he brought down his fist
upon the coping again.</p>
<p>Both women, staring blankly at him, acceded to this
incontrovertible statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and an army&rsquo;s an army&mdash;ye&rsquo;ll
admit that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They admitted it.</p>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>&ldquo;Well, and what be a wall made on?&nbsp; Stones
or bricks.&nbsp; This here wall be made o&rsquo; stones.&nbsp;
And what be an army made on?&nbsp; Men.&nbsp; Do ye take
me?&nbsp; There wouldn&rsquo;t be no wall if there weren&rsquo;t
no stones, and there wouldn&rsquo;t be no army if there
weren&rsquo;t no men.&nbsp; And more&rdquo;&mdash;raising his
voice as he warmed to his subject&mdash;&ldquo;there
wouldn&rsquo;t be no wall if some o&rsquo; them stones
wasn&rsquo;t laid underground for the foundations; and there
wouldn&rsquo;t be no army if there wasn&rsquo;t no
fightin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; some o&rsquo; the men wasn&rsquo;t
killed.&nbsp; An&rsquo; &rsquo;tis my belief, Mrs. Stuckhey, as
your Joe, what has got killed an&rsquo; been put underground, is
one o&rsquo; the foundations o&rsquo; the British army.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; when that there army marches into Ladysmith, as it be
sure to do, your Joe ull ha&rsquo; done as much as any man to get
it there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Susan smiled and wiped her eyes, and held up her head
with a sort of pitiful pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank &rsquo;ee kindly, sir, for them words,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;They be a&rsquo;most the first bit o&rsquo;
comfort I&rsquo;ve a-had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Mr. J&rsquo;yce do speak
beautiful,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Blanchard admiringly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There, I never heared the like, not without &rsquo;twas
out of a noospaper.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure it did ought to comfort
&rsquo;ee, Mrs. Stuckhey.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>&ldquo;Nay, now, &rsquo;tis nothin&rsquo; to speak
on,&rdquo; returned Mr. Joyce modestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;My mind do
seem to turn to them parodies easy like.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye mind
about the rabbits?&nbsp; &lsquo;Rabbits wi&rsquo; guns,&rsquo;
says I.&nbsp; Haw, haw!&nbsp; I can scarce tell how them notions
do come to my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be wonderful, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Blanchard.&nbsp; &ldquo;As I do tell Mrs. Stuckhey, it ought to
comfort her, poor soul.&nbsp; Mrs. Stuckhey have just been
a-layin&rsquo; out five-and-sixpence for something rather
partic&rsquo;lar&mdash;haven&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee, my dear?&nbsp; I
d&rsquo; &rsquo;low Mr. J&rsquo;yce &rsquo;ud like to see what
you&rsquo;ve got in that there parcel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He be welcome, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Susan,
wiping her eyes again and sniffing.</p>
<p>She drew from under her cloak a round object carefully
enveloped in tissue paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to show it to &rsquo;ee, sir, if I mid
make so bold.&nbsp; There, I got me this wi&rsquo; a few
shillin&rsquo; I&rsquo;d been a-layin&rsquo; by for to make a
kind o&rsquo; little feast for my son when he did come
home.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t never expectin&rsquo; as he
wouldn&rsquo;t come home, ye know; there did seem to be so many
of &rsquo;em a-fightin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor mother! while her Joe had lived he had been for her the
only soldier; now that he was dead her thoughts dwelt ceaselessly
on the vast size of the army of which <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>he had formed a part, and it seemed
to her strange and hard that while thousands were spared her
<i>one</i> had been stricken down.</p>
<p>While she spoke she had removed the paper wrappers, and now
held up to Mr. Joyce&rsquo;s admiring, yet somewhat doubtful
gaze, a large china wreath, such as may frequently be seen in
village churchyards, composed of stiff white roses and
conventional leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be a beauty, Mrs. Stuckhey,&rdquo; said the farmer
hesitatingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, I don&rsquo;t believe
I&rsquo;ve ever seen an &rsquo;andsomer one.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m
wonderin&rsquo; how ye mean to manage about it, seein&rsquo; as,
so to speak, there bain&rsquo;t no grave&mdash;not handy, I
mean.&nbsp; There be a grave, as I telled &rsquo;ee, and an
honoured grave&mdash;the grave o&rsquo; the British soldier; but
it wouldn&rsquo;t be&rdquo;&mdash;he coughed
delicately&mdash;&ldquo;convenient for &rsquo;ee to put wreaths
on, I&rsquo;m afeared; nay, I&rsquo;m afeared it wouldn&rsquo;t
be easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lard, no, sir, I wasn&rsquo;t a-thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo;
usin&rsquo; it for the grave.&nbsp; Even if I was to send it to
the War Office I couldn&rsquo;t trust &rsquo;em to put it on for
me.&nbsp; And it wouldn&rsquo;t be no comfort anyhow wi&rsquo;out
I could see it there.&nbsp; Nay, I be a-going to hang this round
my son&rsquo;s likeness; &rsquo;twill be a kind of a memory of
his grave as I can&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Mr. Joyce, deeply
moved.</p>
<p>Poor Susan had begun to weep again, and Mrs. Blanchard was not
slow to follow her example.&nbsp; They moved away together, and
presently, entering Mrs. Stuckhey&rsquo;s house, proceeded to
hang the wreath over poor Joe&rsquo;s picture.&nbsp; After much
hammering of tacks and knotting of string the task was completed,
and the dead soldier&rsquo;s chubby boyish face greeted all
beholders through its white garland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis beautiful, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; exclaimed
Mrs. Blanchard, falling back a little and speaking in a tone of
almost awestruck admiration.&nbsp; &ldquo;The uniform, you know,
and the goldy frame, and the white flowers&mdash;I never seed
anything so handsome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis his due,&rdquo; said Mrs. Stuckhey, and she
was conscious of a return of the glow of pride with which she
had, a little time before, listened to the farmer&rsquo;s
allegory, and with that pride came a faint vague sense of
comfort: at least her hero was honoured.</p>
<p>The poor must be up and doing; not theirs is the luxury of
nursing grief.&nbsp; Though Susan Stuckhey&rsquo;s heart might be
sore, and many hot tears might drop into the suds as she bent
over her wash-tub, her clients&rsquo; clean clothes <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>must be
sent home.&nbsp; She could not manage, however, to be quite so
prompt as usual this particular week, and it chanced that on the
Thursday&mdash;contrary to all precedent&mdash;she was hanging up
some of the finer garments on her line to dry, when she was
startled by what seemed to be the sound of an explosion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They be blastin&rsquo; up yonder,&rdquo; she said to
herself, and went on with her task.&nbsp; But the sound was
repeated several times, and the neighbours began to come to their
doors and to look towards the town, whence the sound
proceeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It do seem like firin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Blanchard with placid interest.</p>
<p>By-and-bye, a lad came tearing down the lane, waving his hat
and shouting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis relieved!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ladysmith be relieved!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true this
time.&nbsp; It be wrote up in the town &lsquo;Official
noos&rsquo;.&nbsp; They be firin&rsquo; a cannon near the Royal
George, and the flags is up, and there&rsquo;s to be a procession
this evenin&rsquo;, and every one&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; mad for
joy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Stuckhey&rsquo;s knees shook under her; she dropped the
handkerchief which she had been pinning up, and covered her face
with her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee take on,&rdquo; said Mrs.
<a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>Blanchard, commiseratingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;d be
like to feel it, I know; dear, yes, &rsquo;tis to be
expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I should think Mrs. Stuckhey ought to be
glad,&rdquo; said Mrs. Woolridge, surveying the washerwoman
critically from her doorstep.&nbsp; &ldquo;There be
mothers&rsquo; sons in Ladysmith so well as anywhere else; ah,
sure there be.&nbsp; Many a woman&rsquo;s heart has been
a-breakin&rsquo; thinkin&rsquo; of &rsquo;em starvin&rsquo; and
famishin&rsquo; there.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t bring your
son back a bit more if they was to perish o&rsquo; hunger.&nbsp;
You ought to be glad like the rest of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; gasped poor Susan; and with that she
turned, leaving her basket, and went into her house.</p>
<p>Her gaze, blurred though it was with tears, instantly sought
Joe&rsquo;s portrait, and the honest goggle eyes of the picture
looked back, as it seemed to her, with infinite sadness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladysmith is relieved,&rdquo; they seemed to say;
&ldquo;the victory is won&mdash;and I was not there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When presently the door creaked slowly open and Mrs. Blanchard
entered, moving unwieldily on tip-toe, she found Susan seated by
her steaming wash-tub with her apron thrown over her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee fret, my dear,&rdquo; she said
soothingly.&nbsp; <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t one in the village as
don&rsquo;t sympathise for &rsquo;ee; and we do all feel as our
own j&rsquo;y bain&rsquo;t full, so to speak.&nbsp; There, we do
say to ourselves: If our own soldier was wi&rsquo; the others how
proud we mid be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Stuckhey did not answer, but pressed her apron more
closely to her face with her trembling hands.&nbsp; Poor
hands&mdash;seamed and sodden and, as it were, pock-marked from
perpetual immersion in the suds; knotted and distorted by hard
and heavy work&mdash;what a tale they told of privation and of
toil!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree wi&rsquo; Martha Woolridge,&rdquo;
went on the visitor after a pause.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t fair to say as you have no
feelin&rsquo; for the poor folks as was shut up over
yonder.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis but nat&rsquo;ral you should be sorry
your Joe didn&rsquo;t have no hand in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan jerked down her apron, and her eyes flashed beneath
their red and swollen lids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who says he didn&rsquo;t have no hand in it?&rdquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;He did have a hand in it!&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t
&rsquo;ee hear what Farmer Joyce did say?&nbsp; My son Joe were
one o&rsquo; the foundations o&rsquo; the army.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
rose as she spoke and crossed the kitchen, her small figure
dignified, even majestic.</p>
<p>She fumbled in the old-fashioned chest of drawers and drew
forth a paper packet.&nbsp; <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>Returning, she laid it upon the
table, casting, as she did so, a glance at once severe and
resolute upon the astonished Mrs. Blanchard; then, taking her
sweeping-brush from behind the door, she proceeded with much
deliberation to knock off its head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name o&rsquo; fortun&rsquo;, Susan
Stuckhey,&rdquo; ejaculated her friend, &ldquo;what be you
a-goin&rsquo; to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see for yourself in a minute,&rdquo;
returned Susan; and, armed with the broom-handle and the little
parcel, she went upstairs.</p>
<p>Mrs. Blanchard went out, backing away from the house, and
fixing her eyes wonderingly, almost incredulously, on
Susan&rsquo;s upper window.&nbsp; Following the direction of her
glance, Mrs. Woolridge and a few other women who had meanwhile
gathered together gazed also expectantly upwards.&nbsp; Presently
the latticed casement was thrown open and a sudden gleam of blue
and scarlet fluttered over their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me, woman, whatever are you at?&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Woolridge in shocked and horrified tones.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye
don&rsquo;t mean to say as you can have the
heart&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan&rsquo;s resolute face looked forth a moment above her
waving banner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be a-doin&rsquo; what my son Joe did tell I to <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>do.&nbsp; I
be a-hangin&rsquo; out a flag for the victory as he&rsquo;ve
a-helped to win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when, later in the day, the town band paraded gaily
through the village with a large following of enthusiastic
patriots dancing, shouting, singing, the little mother strove
valiantly to fulfil the second part of poor Joe&rsquo;s
behest&mdash;to give the three cheers for which he had
called.&nbsp; But though she ran to her gate when the crowd first
came in sight, and waved her arm above her head, only a strangled
sob broke from her when she strove to raise her voice. But at
sight of the small figure in its mourning dress, the little
cotton Union Jack waving gallantly from the upper window of the
dead soldier&rsquo;s home, a sudden hush fell upon the musicians
and their followers, and they passed the house in silence with
bared heads and reverent tread.</p>
<p>And perhaps this tribute of respect was paid less to the
emblem of their country&rsquo;s greatness, less even to the
memory of the poor young hero who had laid down his life for its
sake, than to the brave little woman who stood unflinchingly at
her post, and who felt her heart beat high with sacred triumph
though the tears were raining down her face.</p>

<h2><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>A
RUSTIC ARGUS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was evening; most of the
inhabitants of the old-world village were standing about their
doorways, and a few of the more energetic were at work in their
tiny patches of garden.&nbsp; It was noticeable that those among
the men who had not betaken themselves to the allotments leaned
in lordly fashion against their door-posts or lolled over the
garden hedge, deeming, no doubt, that they had already borne
their share of the burden of the day, and that such trifling
supplementary labour as watering cabbages or tying up carnations
might well be left to the women-folk.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fripp seemed to accept this state of things without
protest.&nbsp; She was a stout woman, and the weather was
warm.&nbsp; She had been busy all day at her wash-tub, and she
groaned as she bent her bulky person over the flowers that would
keep slipping away from her large, moist fingers just as she had
deemed they were secure.</p>
<p><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>&ldquo;Drat it!&rdquo; she murmured under her breath,
as a beautiful bloom slid from its stick for the fourth time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They be ticklish things,&rdquo; observed Mr. Fripp from
his station in the doorway, without taking the trouble to remove
his pipe, and speaking in consequence somewhat
indistinctly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, they be ticklish things.&nbsp;
They d&rsquo; take a dale o&rsquo; patience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That they do!&rdquo; agreed his spouse heartily,
standing upright, and straightening her broad back.&nbsp; She
looked half absently up and down the sloping village street,
which lay deep in shadow, save at the uppermost end, where the
gables of the thatched houses were bathed in the evening glow,
the light falling full upon the whitewashed chimney-stack of the
little hostelry known as the &ldquo;Pure Drop,&rdquo; and
creeping downwards along the irregular line of roofs until it
terminated abruptly just where Mrs. Fripp&rsquo;s wash-house
jutted out into the street.&nbsp; Seen thus at this mystic hour
there was much beauty about the little hamlet, which, indeed, at
any time had a quaint charm of its own.&nbsp; The eaves of many
of the roofs sloped downwards at certain points almost to the
ground, overhanging here a mullioned window, and bulging out
there <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>into a minute and fantastically shaped gable.&nbsp;
Creepers clung close to the whitewashed walls, hollyhocks stood
in many a homely garden with the stateliness they might better
have assumed in the pleasaunce of a queen; pigeons bowed and
cooed on the sunlit apex of russet roof or golden stack; children
played about the doorsteps or made pies of the dust in the
road.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Fripp gazed on these things indifferently, her glance
having fixed itself on a tall, angular woman&rsquo;s figure which
was at that moment travelling slowly towards her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis never Mrs. Adlam steppin&rsquo; this
way&mdash;come to look after Susan, I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low.&nbsp;
Them two girls hey been gossipin&rsquo; in there this hour
an&rsquo; more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be about Tom Locke, I&rsquo;ll warrant,
that they&rsquo;re a-talkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; agreed her lord, the
black pipe wagging with every word, and being sucked at the
conclusion of the sentence with evident relish.&nbsp; &ldquo;Aye,
aye; maids will get talkin&rsquo; about sweethearts an&rsquo;
that.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis naitral at their age, an&rsquo; this
accident o&rsquo; pore Tom&rsquo;s is oncommon
onfart&rsquo;nate.&nbsp; Good-day, Mrs. Adlam, &rsquo;tis
powerful warm, &rsquo;tis, surely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Adlam hurriedly and
abstractedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-day to ye, Mr. Fripp.&nbsp; Is
Susan within?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Mr. Fripp, without moving his
form from the door-post, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s sittin&rsquo; a bit
wi&rsquo; our Lizzie.&nbsp; Our maid&rsquo;s jest foldin&rsquo; a
few clothes for her mother to iron to-morrow, an&rsquo;
Susan&rsquo;s sittin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, neighbour, your Lizzie&rsquo;s wonderful handy,
they say,&rdquo; responded Mrs. Adlam&mdash;without enthusiasm,
however.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, my maid&rsquo;s that delicate
an&rsquo; nervous like, she&rsquo;s no use at all at home, I may
say.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had to have doctor to her times an&rsquo;
times, but &rsquo;tis no manner o&rsquo; use.&nbsp; She
can&rsquo;t do many things for herself, pore maid; an&rsquo; she
can scarce abear to see me a-doin&rsquo; of &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a nesh flower, neighbours.&nbsp; Why, she d&rsquo; run
out o&rsquo; the room when I put our bit o&rsquo; beef of a
Sunday to the fire, an&rsquo; she d&rsquo; very near faint if I
go for to skin a rabbit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to think on&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Mr. and Mrs.
Fripp together, commiseratingly, but admiringly, too.&nbsp; Such
a constitution as Susan&rsquo;s was felt to be a credit to any
village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, &rsquo;tis a nesh flower,&rdquo; repeated the
mother with a kind of fretful triumph.&nbsp; &ldquo;Laist time
Doctor Richmond come I explained to him as well as I could how
she be took, an&rsquo; I says to him: &lsquo;Could you tell me,
sir,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;what &rsquo;tis as ails my
daughter?&rsquo;&nbsp; An&rsquo; he looks <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>at me so
earnest as he could, an&rsquo; he said &rsquo;twas&mdash;oh, a
terrible long name&mdash;it always slips my mind, but it&rsquo;s
awful long.&nbsp; Wait a bit; I&rsquo;ll have it in a
minute.&nbsp; Ye mind that climbin&rsquo; tree as runs round the
corner o&rsquo; the &lsquo;Pure Drop&rsquo;?&nbsp; It do have
blue blossoms in the spring-time, hangin&rsquo; down summat
o&rsquo; the natur o&rsquo; laburnum.&nbsp; You know, Mrs.
Fripp&mdash;so fond of flowers as you be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, we had wan at my father&rsquo;s place&mdash;he was
gardener, ye know&mdash;I d&rsquo; call it to mind, now.&nbsp;
Westonia, that&rsquo;s what it be called.&nbsp; Nay, now;
westeria&mdash;that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Adlam; adding,
with impressive solemnity, &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s
the matter wi&rsquo; my Susan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very like,&rdquo; assented Mrs. Fripp, who was an
imaginative woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis but a pore nesh thing,
that creeper&mdash;never has no leaves till &rsquo;tis well-nigh
done flowerin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such fancies as she d&rsquo; take even in the way
o&rsquo; courtin&rsquo;,&rdquo; resumed Mrs. Adlam.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Says she to me once: &lsquo;Mother,&rsquo; says she,
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t you count on me ever gettin&rsquo; wed, for I
assure ye I abhor mankind.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Fripp, much startled
and infinitely scandalised.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas an
unnait&rsquo;ral thing for a maid to say, sure.&nbsp; Never <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>heard
o&rsquo; such a thing.&nbsp; I be sorry for ye, Mrs. Adlam, that
I be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She takes them notions out o&rsquo; the books that she
d&rsquo; read when she be porely,&rdquo; returned the mother,
apologetically.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s where she gets
&rsquo;em; but I do assure you, neighbours, them was her very
words.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t notice her no more than if she was a
child.&nbsp; I did think a few months ago, in spite of all, that
she&rsquo;d be gettin&rsquo; settled so comfortable as she could
be.&nbsp; Tom Locke &rsquo;s a good, studdy young chap,
earnin&rsquo; a good bit, now.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be havin&rsquo;
the farm, too, when his father dies.&nbsp; But the maid is so
upset about that accident, I don&rsquo;t know whatever to do
wi&rsquo; her.&nbsp; I thought she&rsquo;d get over the
feelin&rsquo; about his losin&rsquo; that eye; but it laisses so
strong as ever.&nbsp; He came to our place this evenin&rsquo;,
an&rsquo; she did jump up an&rsquo; run straight away here.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ve a-been waitin&rsquo; an&rsquo; waitin&rsquo;, pore
young man, but at laist he gets up, an&rsquo; says he:
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go, Mrs. Adlam.&nbsp; Will &rsquo;ee tell Susan
that if she wants to see me again, she can meet me up the lane at
the wold place on Sunday?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Fripp, gazing thoughtfully up
the street again, and then suffering her glance to revert to Mrs.
Adlam&rsquo;s lean, anxious face, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis terrible hard
for &rsquo;ee, &rsquo;tis <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>indeed.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry for
pore Tom, yet &rsquo;tis an awk&rsquo;ard thing for a girl to wed
wi&rsquo; a man as has but one eye.&nbsp; An&rsquo; Susan being
so bashful an&rsquo; tewly seems to make it worse.&nbsp; Does he
look terrible bad, Mrs. Adlam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Adlam considered.&nbsp; &ldquo;One side looks much the
same as ever,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Aye, one eye&rsquo;s
jest like it always was, but t&rsquo;other side&rdquo;&mdash;She
paused.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no eye at all
t&rsquo;other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor took it out, did he?&rdquo; inquired Fripp,
deeply interested.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Adlam,
&rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t so bad but it mid have been worse&mdash;we
must comfort ourselves so well as we can.&nbsp; If keeper
hadn&rsquo;t been by, an&rsquo; hadn&rsquo;t out wi&rsquo;s
knife, same as he did, an&rsquo; took shots out o&rsquo;
Tom&rsquo;s eye at once, he&rsquo;d very like have lost
t&rsquo;other one.&nbsp; As I say, it mid ha&rsquo; been
worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom said jest now as doctor thought keeper&rsquo;d
ha&rsquo; done better to ha&rsquo; left his eye alone,&rdquo;
sighed Mrs. Adlam.&nbsp; &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no
tellin&rsquo;&mdash;doctors is jealous folk; they can&rsquo;t
abear a body to do a thing for theirselves.&nbsp; Why, laist
winter when I had the inflammation, an&rsquo; made mysel&rsquo; a
drop o&rsquo; gruel wi&rsquo; rum in it to strengthen me a bit,
Doctor Richmond was that vexed!&nbsp; Well, I must be
goin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Will &rsquo;ee call my maid, Mr.
Fripp?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>The
good man complied.&nbsp; Screwing his person a little sideways
round the door-post, and turning his head over his shoulder, he
bellowed forth, first the name of his own daughter and then that
of Mrs. Adlam&rsquo;s, at intervals of about a quarter of a
minute, until there was a hasty banging of doors in the back
premises, a patter of feet across the kitchen, and the two girls
appeared simultaneously on the threshold.&nbsp; Susan Adlam,
tall, fair, and blue-eyed, with the complexion of a rose-leaf,
and hands so white that they told their own tale of selfishness
and incapacity; Lizzie Fripp, dark, with a brown merry face, and
a squat sturdy form.&nbsp; With a little more height and a little
less breadth she might have been pretty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, &rsquo;tis you, Mother,&rdquo; said Susan, with a
bashful wriggle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is Tom gone?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I
hope he is.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t ask me to go home if he&rsquo;s
there, for I couldn&rsquo;t abear to see en.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Adlam cast up her eyes to heaven, and then looked round
with a certain melancholy pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&nbsp; Come along, my dear, he&rsquo;s gone;
an&rsquo; I was to say if ye wanted to spaik to en again you was
to meet en at the wold place o&rsquo; Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>&ldquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t want to see en
again,&rdquo; said Susan tossing her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For shame!&rdquo; cried little Lizzie.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
wonder at ye, Susan.&nbsp; The pore chap&rsquo;ll break his
&rsquo;eart.&nbsp; An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s an eye, after
all?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t real needful to a man&mdash;not
like as if it was an arm now, so as he couldn&rsquo;t work for
&rsquo;ee, or a leg, so as he&rsquo;d have to have a wooden un,
an&rsquo; go <i>peggety-peg</i> up church.&nbsp; Nay, now,
there&rsquo;d be raison if &rsquo;twas an arm or a leg&mdash;but
a body can see as well wi&rsquo; one eye as wi&rsquo;
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark to the maid!&rdquo; cried Mr. Fripp, with a great
roar of laughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;She d&rsquo; spaik like
print.&nbsp; Well done, little un!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not fond of one-eyed folks if you
be,&rdquo; cried Susan sarcastically.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d not
have a man without two eyes, not if I was to bide single all my
life.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d as lief be single as not&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
no fancy for wedlock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear,&rdquo; said Fripp, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
terrible to hear how onraisonable the pore maid d&rsquo;
talk!&nbsp; Take her home, do, Mrs. Adlam, an&rsquo; make her lay
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along then, Susan,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Adlam with an
air of chastened dignity; &ldquo;come along, else you&rsquo;ll be
havin&rsquo; the westeria again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, now, Mother, &rsquo;tis <i>heasteria</i> ye
mean.&nbsp; <a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>Doctor said plain as the name of it was
heasteria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lard, child, heast or west, &rsquo;tis all one.&nbsp;
You come home wi&rsquo; me, do &rsquo;ee now, else you&rsquo;ll
be laid up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew one of the pretty white hands through her own bony
arm and led her daughter gently away, supporting her with
increasing solicitude, as the girl, conscious of attracting
universal attention, began to limp and to stagger in the most
interesting manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pore thing!&rdquo; murmured Fripp
commiseratingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;She d&rsquo; seem to be
falterin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low &rsquo;tis a
terrible visitation for Mrs. Adlam, &rsquo;tis surely.&nbsp;
Well, Mother, let us give thanks where thanks be due.&nbsp;
Lizzie, here, is a good set off to t&rsquo;other one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d better be,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Fripp,
speaking loudly and decisively for Lizzie&rsquo;s benefit.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have no patience wi&rsquo; such goin&rsquo;s
on.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d take a bit o&rsquo; broom-end to her instead
o&rsquo; the doctor if I were Mrs. Adlam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well said!&rdquo; chimed in a red-faced matron from the
other side of the hedge.&nbsp; &ldquo;It never does no good to
spile childer.&nbsp; Says I to mine soon&rsquo;s ever they grow
up: &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve gi&rsquo;ed ye a
good educassion, and now yer claaws must keep yer jaaws,&rsquo; I
says.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>Though the education which the good lady in question
had bestowed upon her progeny was known to be of a somewhat
questionable order, and though the said progeny were by no means
considered creditable to the community at large, the theory was
so sound in itself that the Fripps agreed heartily; and the
sentiment was endorsed by the village policeman, who for the last
few minutes had been listening unobserved to the discussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I call
straightfor&rsquo;ard.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yer claaws must keep yer
jaaws,&rsquo; says you.&nbsp; If Susan Adlam had nothing to put
into her mouth but what her &rsquo;ands got for her she&rsquo;d
starve, pore young craiture.&nbsp; But tis a very foolish
business about Tom Locke.&nbsp; The young man&rsquo;s a fine
young man, doin&rsquo; well, an&rsquo; like to do better&mdash;an
eye more nor less doesn&rsquo;t alter his being a wonderful good
match for the girl.&nbsp; But if she&rsquo;s so set on his
havin&rsquo; a pair, why doesn&rsquo;t he get a mock un put
in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mock eye!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Fripp in
amazement.&nbsp; &ldquo;My stars!&nbsp; I never heard tell
o&rsquo; such a thing.&nbsp; You be jokin&rsquo; surely,
policeman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, not I indeed.&nbsp; I knowed a man livin&rsquo;
out Tipton way as lost his eye on account o&rsquo; a bit o&rsquo;
blasted rock goin&rsquo; into it; an&rsquo; he went <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>to Bristol
an&rsquo; come back wi&rsquo; a beautiful new un&mdash;ye&rsquo;d
scarce know it from his own, only it were a deal
handsomer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash; my eyes!&rdquo; murmured Mr. Fripp, not with
any intentional profanity, but because the expletive seemed
peculiarly adapted to the circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I knowed him well.&nbsp; Many a time he&rsquo;s
took out the glass eye to let me see it.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a
wonderful invention, an&rsquo; it cost I believe a sight o&rsquo;
money.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t wear it every day, but he allus put
it in o&rsquo; market-days an&rsquo; Sundays.&nbsp; Ah,
&rsquo;twas a curious thing to see en o&rsquo; Sundays,
lookin&rsquo; at parson so wide-awake wi&rsquo; the glass eye,
while t&rsquo;other maybe was as drowsy as yours or mine mid
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I never!&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Fripp.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Somebody ought to tell young Locke about it,&rdquo; she
added, as an afterthought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t exactly the kind o&rsquo; subject a
body &rsquo;ud think o&rsquo; namin&rsquo; to the pore
man,&rdquo; said the policeman, who was a person of refined
feelings.&nbsp; &ldquo;To say &lsquo;Good-day to ye, an&rsquo;
why don&rsquo;t ye get a glass eye?&rsquo; &rsquo;ud seem a bit
strange.&nbsp; Well, neighbours, I must be movin&rsquo; on.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a pity for the pore chap; but we must feel grateful
for him as Providence didn&rsquo;t see fit to try en no
worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>On
the next Sunday afternoon, after Lizzie had cleared away the
dinner things, and fed the chickens, and scrubbed the faces of
her little brothers and sisters previous to their departure for
Sunday School, she donned her white straw hat, with its big red
rose nodding triumphantly from a commanding position just over
the centre of her forehead, pinned a posy of carnations and
jasmine and southern-wood in the bosom of her blue dress, drew a
new pair of cotton gloves over her plump hands, and sallied forth
up the street to call on Susan.</p>
<p>She found Mrs. Adlam with her Sunday gown pinned back over a
striped petticoat, her sleeves rolled up as high as Sunday
sleeves would go, and a further protection against possible
accidents in the shape of a large-bibbed apron shrouding the
remainder of her Sabbath glories, hard at work washing up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-day, Mrs. Adlam.&nbsp; I jest called round to see
how Susan mid be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-day, Lizzie.&nbsp; Susan&rsquo;s very bad, thank
ye.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s layin&rsquo; on her bed upstairs.&nbsp;
Step up if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lizzie stepped up, and found her friend reclining outside her
patchwork quilt, absorbed in the perusal of a &ldquo;penny
dreadful&rdquo; of the most thrilling type.&nbsp; Lizzie
approached the <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>bed, clumping sturdily with her well-polished best
boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bain&rsquo;t ye agoin&rsquo; to see pore Tom?&rdquo;
she inquired, without wasting time on preliminaries.</p>
<p>Susan looked up, startled: she had just got to that point in
the narrative when the heroine, drawing herself up to her full
height, informed the villain that she would be sooner clasped by
a serpent than permit herself to be degraded by his embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&nbsp; No, I&rsquo;m not going to see Tom
Locke.&nbsp; My nerves is much too upset.&nbsp; Ye did give me a
jump comin&rsquo; in that way, Lizzie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be waiting up there for you to spaik to
en.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t my fault if he do.&nbsp; I
never axed en to.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m real fainty an&rsquo; porely
to-day, Lizzie; couldn&rsquo;t so much as go to church.&nbsp; Sit
down, an&rsquo; let&rsquo;s talk a bit.&nbsp; I seed yer father
lookin&rsquo; arter me t&rsquo;other night; I was walkin&rsquo;
so queer, wasn&rsquo;t I?&nbsp; I expect he thought I was
lookin&rsquo; real bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll not sit down,&rdquo; said Lizzie.&nbsp;
She planted her umbrella on the floor, and stared at the other
girl for a moment without speaking.</p>
<p><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>&ldquo;If he was to get another eye would ye look at en
then?&rdquo; she remarked at length, abruptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
mock un, I mane.&nbsp; They can be had easy, Policeman Blanchard
says.&nbsp; No good to see out of, ye know, but jest to look
at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lizzie, what a tale!&nbsp; He was makin&rsquo; fun
o&rsquo; you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas to father he
said it.&nbsp; He said he knowed a man Tipton way as had
un&mdash;rale &rsquo;andsome&mdash;&rsquo;andsomer nor his
own.&nbsp; He wore it Sundays an&rsquo; &rsquo;olidays, an&rsquo;
took it out week days for fear o&rsquo; accidents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Susan, consideringly, &ldquo;if Tom
were to get un perhaps I could forget it were a mock un; but
he&rsquo;d have to wear it always, that he would, else I
couldn&rsquo;t make believe &rsquo;twere real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go an&rsquo; tell en that.&nbsp; If he
gets a real nice one ye&rsquo;ll think on&rsquo;t, won&rsquo;t
ye, Susan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno; I&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; said Susan
provisionally.</p>
<p>Lizzie marched towards the door without another word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a funny notion, though, yer takin&rsquo; it
up like that,&rdquo; cried Susan, suddenly awaking to the
fact.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be ye really goin&rsquo; to en now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I be,&rdquo; replied Lizzie, without turning her
head; and down the stairs clattered she, and out into the
air.</p>
<p><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>Leaving the village behind she ascended a steep, stony
path, which led across a curious and antiquated bridge, and
presently found herself in a shady lane bordered on both sides by
high banks, where the hedgerows had long escaped all control of
man, and grew in a wild and most picturesque tangle.&nbsp; Here
thorn and gorse and wild apple crowded upon each other; golden
maple was thrown into relief by the sturdier green of the elder;
there the clustering berries of a guelder-rose, already turning
red, made a wondrous patch of colour, while the tiny,
soft-shelled hazel nuts shone out from the deep green leaves like
pearls; over all the traveller&rsquo;s-joy had flung its wealth
of delicate blossom and clinging tendril, now swinging proudly
from the topmost bough of a tall sapling, now creeping low amidst
the brambles and the bracken.&nbsp; A yellow-hammer called to a
brother occasionally from some swaying twig; little speckled
half-fledged robins hopped along the path in front of Lizzie,
taking occasional short flights when she came inconveniently
near, but returning to peer up at her with large, yellow-rimmed,
curious eyes.</p>
<p>Lizzie noticed none of these things.&nbsp; Had she had a mind
to gaze upon the beauties <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>of the prospect, she would have
peered through the gaps in the green ramparts down to the plain,
and away past the cultivated fields and the silver windings of
the river to the distant roofs and chimney-stacks of the market
town.&nbsp; One could obtain a beautiful view of the new brewery
from here; the brickwork looked as red as red, and one could see
the smoke rising from the great chimney.&nbsp; Ah, that was a
view worth looking at; so all the villagers said, and Lizzie
agreed with them.</p>
<p>But to-day she stared straight in front of her, with eyes as
round and curious as those of the robins themselves; eyes which
had, moreover, an alarmed expression entirely lacking to those of
the bold, sociable little birds in question.&nbsp; Her heart was
beginning to beat rather fast, and she was conscious of
increasing trepidation as she drew near the trysting-place.</p>
<p>At a turn of the lane she could see a pair of long legs thrust
out from a recess in the bank; then a hand idly brandishing a
stick; at length a head moving amid the clustering leaves.&nbsp;
When the rapid <i>clump</i>, <i>clump</i> of her thick-soled
boots reached his ears, the man rose quickly and came towards
her.&nbsp; A tall, loose-limbed, young fellow, with a fringe of
dark beard and whisker round his brown face; his hat was <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>pulled
rather forward over his brows, and his one remaining eye looked
eagerly and anxiously towards the approaching figure.</p>
<p>One glance told him that the sturdy form was not that of his
sweetheart, and he turned away, whistling to himself to hide his
disappointment, and swishing absently at the wayside
grasses.&nbsp; He expected the rapid steps to pass on; but, to
his surprise, they slackened as they drew near, and then abruptly
ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-day to &rsquo;ee, Mr. Locke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Locke, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Lizzie
Fripp.&nbsp; Good-day, Lizzie, good-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned unwillingly as he spoke.&nbsp; Though not by nature
a sensitive man, he felt a little diffident as to the impression
which his new disfigurement was likely to create when first
beheld by a stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye be waitin&rsquo; for Susan?&rdquo; said Lizzie,
staring hard for a moment and then averting her eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s&mdash;she&rsquo;s not able to come
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought as much,&rdquo; said Tom gloomily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been sittin&rsquo; here two hour an&rsquo;
more.&nbsp; Did she send ye to me?&rdquo; he added suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I came myself.&nbsp; I wanted to tell &rsquo;ee
somethin&rsquo;, Mr. Locke,&rdquo; blurted out Lizzie
tremulously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low that if you was
to <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>get a
glass eye Susan &rsquo;ud love you jest the same as
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dark flush overspread the young farmer&rsquo;s face, and a
flash of anger appeared in his solitary orb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she tell &rsquo;ee to say this?&rdquo; he asked,
after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay now, nay now, don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee take on so, Mr.
Locke.&nbsp; They was all talkin&rsquo; about it in the village
laist night; an&rsquo; Policeman Blanchard said he knowed a man
as had one that could be took in an&rsquo; out quite handy,
an&rsquo; it looked jest the same as t&rsquo;other, only
&rsquo;andsomer.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I axed Susan if ye was to get
one would she walk with &rsquo;ee again, an&rsquo; she seemed to
take to the notion; so I thought I&rsquo;d jest run here
an&rsquo; tell &rsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did ye?&rdquo; said Tom.&nbsp; &ldquo;That was very
well done, Lizzie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought &rsquo;twas but kind,&rdquo; said
Lizzie modestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Susan, ye see, has a terrible
delicate constitootion, an&rsquo; takes things to
&rsquo;eart.&nbsp; Why, she could scarce so much as walk home
from our place laist night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; returned Locke
sardonically.&nbsp; &ldquo;She run fast enough out o&rsquo; my
way&mdash;I know that.&nbsp; Aye, she showed as clean a pair
o&rsquo; heels as a maid need wish to.&nbsp; An&rsquo; <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>so she said
she&rsquo;d take to me again if I was to get a glass eye, did
she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said she&rsquo;d think on&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned
the girl cautiously.</p>
<p>Tom took off his hat and bent down till his face was nearly on
a level with Lizzie&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Lizzie Fripp,&rdquo; he said
authoritatively; &ldquo;you be a trewth-tellin&rsquo; maid,
an&rsquo; ye&rsquo;ll gi&rsquo;e me a straightfor&rsquo;ard
answer.&nbsp; Tell me plain!&nbsp; I was reckoned a fairish
good-lookin&rsquo; chap till now, but this accident has spiled my
looks for me.&nbsp; Tell me the trewth.&nbsp; Am I such an object
that any maid would run away from me, or is it jest Susan
that&rsquo;s extra pertic&rsquo;lar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lizzie raised her honest brown eyes and gazed at him
steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not an object, Mr. Locke,&rdquo; she said
thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear no, not at all an object.&nbsp; I
think a body &rsquo;ud soon get used to&mdash;to one side
bein&rsquo; a little different from t&rsquo;other.&nbsp; But some
maids takes notions, ye see.&nbsp; My mother said she never could
abide red hair.&nbsp; If father&rsquo;d hev been a red-haired man
she&rsquo;d never ha&rsquo; married him.&nbsp; Now <i>I</i> think
&rsquo;tis much the same as any other colour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom slowly straightened himself.&nbsp; A smile was hovering
about his mouth.</p>
<p><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;d look better with a glass
eye?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Lizzie dispassionately, &ldquo;I
think it &rsquo;ud be very nice for Sundays, Mr. Locke.&nbsp;
Sundays an&rsquo; market-days, or when ye was goin&rsquo; for a
drive in the trap, or such like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Tom, meditatively stroking his
beard.&nbsp; &ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps I&rsquo;ll talk to doctor
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do,&rdquo; she urged eagerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
d&rsquo; &rsquo;low Susan &rsquo;ll be real pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Tom.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be ye goin&rsquo;
home now, Lizzie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I only came this way to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, an&rsquo; did ye?&nbsp; Well, &rsquo;twas very
kindly done of you.&nbsp; Come, I&rsquo;ll walk a piece of the
way with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked a piece of the way&mdash;indeed, he walked all the
way; and Lizzie thought within herself, as they trudged along,
that if any stranger met them who did not know them, he might
have taken them for sweethearts; for they walked in almost
unbroken silence, just as courting people did, and Tom kept very
close to her, and when they came to a rough piece of road he
supported her by the elbow, just as he might have done if she had
been Susan.</p>
<p><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>That
young lady happened to be leaning languidly against her door-post
when the couple drew near.&nbsp; She had been looking up the road
as though expecting somebody, and at sight of Tom uttered a faint
shriek and rushed into the house, closing the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pore Susan!&rdquo; cried Lizzie commiseratingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It has given her a turn to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Locke made no reply, but, after a moment, coming to the
precipitous descent which led downwards from the bridge, he
supported Lizzie very kindly, and was indeed good enough at one
particularly stony bit to encircle her waist with his arm.&nbsp;
They parted at the Adlams&rsquo; door, and Lizzie tripped
joyfully upstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; she cried gaily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s promised to see about gettin&rsquo; a new eye,
Susan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Adlam turned abruptly away from the window where she
chanced to be standing, and cast a suspicious glance upon her
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was Tom Locke&rsquo;s arm doin&rsquo; round your
waist?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the path was so steep,&rdquo; explained Lizzie,
opening her eyes very wide.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter,
Susan?&nbsp; Bain&rsquo;t ye so well this
evenin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>For
Susan was making an odd sort of gulping noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye sly thing!&rdquo; she burst out suddenly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lard! I wouldn&rsquo;t be so treecherous&mdash;that I
wouldn&rsquo;t; running after en afore my very eyes.&nbsp; Get
along with &rsquo;ee, do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have nothin&rsquo;
more to say to &rsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lizzie stared for a moment, thunderstruck, her usually rosy
face turning quite pale, and tears presently rushing to her
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Susan,&rdquo; she said, as soon as she had
recovered her breath, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it of &rsquo;ee
to turn on me so sudden.&nbsp; I never did nothin&rsquo; but what
was for yer good.&nbsp; I thought it &rsquo;ud plaze ye.&nbsp;
But there, you can manage en for yourself now.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t care if Tom Locke doesn&rsquo;t get no new eye at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hurried from the room, leaving Susan convulsively choking
and sobbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear heart! dear heart! she&rsquo;s took wi&rsquo; the
westeria again,&rdquo; groaned Mrs. Adlam, as she went creaking
up the stairs.</p>
<p>But little Lizzie made no response.&nbsp; Her cheeks were red
enough now, and she metaphorically shook the dust of the Adlam
premises from her feet as she closed the garden gate behind
her.</p>
<p>She kept religiously away from her former <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>friend
throughout the week, but when Sunday came round that young lady
actually condescended to pay her a visit.&nbsp; Susan arrived
attired in white, with a wreath of daisies round her hat, and a
great bunch of monthly roses in her waistband; the coils of her
fair hair shone like gold in the sunlight&mdash;she was a harmony
of white and pink and yellow, very pleasant to behold,
particularly as her face was flushed with unwonted excitement,
and her eyes were bright and eager.</p>
<p>Lizzie received her in the orchard, where she was feeding the
chickens.&nbsp; She was not yet dressed for the afternoon, it
being her mother&rsquo;s turn to go to church, and various
household duties falling in consequence to her share to-day; but
she had put on the clean print which was to serve her throughout
the coming week, and a big white apron over that.&nbsp; Her curly
brown hair was plaited very neatly, and her sleeves rolled up
high on her firm plump arms.&nbsp; The sun glanced down through
the heavily laden apple boughs upon her active little figure as
she flitted from one hen-coop to another dispensing handfuls of
yellow meal to the half-fledged chickens that ran in and out
between the bars; her bright tin bucket glittered in the rays,
and the little brown tendrils on her forehead danced up and down
with the rapidity of her movements.</p>

&ldquo;Oh, Lizzie, I&rsquo;ve such a piece of news for

</div>
</div>
<p><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; she remarked, not
quite so cordially as usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; cried Susan eagerly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, Lizzie, I&rsquo;ve such a piece of news for you!&nbsp;
Tom Locke has been away all the week, and they d&rsquo; say
he&rsquo;s jest come back wi&rsquo; two eyes&mdash;a new
imitation one that looks jest the same as
t&rsquo;other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he truly?&rdquo; responded Lizzie, her lingering
resentment forgotten, and a broad smile beaming on her
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I <i>am</i> glad, I am, sure.&nbsp;
Ye&rsquo;ll be willin&rsquo; to take up wi&rsquo; en now,
Susan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; responded the other, with a
little toss of the head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t answer for
myself altogether, but I&rsquo;ll try to conquer my
feelin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m jest thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo;
takin&rsquo; a stroll over the bridge yonder an&rsquo; up the
lane towards Locke&rsquo;s.&nbsp; An&rsquo; if I do happen to
meet en we&rsquo;ll see how things turns out, Lizzie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it chanced that the meeting with Tom Locke was to take
place under different circumstances than those which his
sweetheart had anticipated.&nbsp; At that very moment the portly
form of Mrs. Fripp emerged from the <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>back door of the cottage, followed
by the tall figure of a man&mdash;a man whose bearded brown face
was enlivened by a pair of beautiful brown eyes.&nbsp; He
advanced straight to Lizzie, beaming with pleasure and manly
pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day to &rsquo;ee, Lizzie,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve jest come to ax if ye&rsquo;ll go for a walk
wi&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Locke, ye mane Susan, surely?&rdquo; stammered
the little rosy-faced damsel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you didn&rsquo;t see that I was here,&rdquo; said
Susan, coming forward with a coquettish sidle and a fatuous
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Susan, I seed ye very well.&nbsp; I was sorry to
hear ye was so porely&mdash;I hope ye&rsquo;re feelin&rsquo; a
trifle better now.&nbsp; Well, Lizzie my dear, ye&rsquo;ll
gi&rsquo;e me an answer, won&rsquo;t ye?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be
truly pleased to take &rsquo;ee for a walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls looked at one another; the fiery light of
animosity beginning to shine in Susan&rsquo;s eyes; wonder,
confusion, and a kind of doubtful pleasure perceptible in
Lizzie&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye see &rsquo;tis this way,&rdquo; proceeded Locke, in
an affably explanatory tone, &ldquo;I took yer advice, Lizzie,
an&rsquo; got fixed wi&rsquo; a new eye at Bristol.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; ye wouldn&rsquo;t believe the difference it has made to
my sight.&nbsp; Lard! I wonder I could ha&rsquo; been so blind
before!&nbsp; But I see <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>clear now at last, an&rsquo; I see,
my maid, that you&rsquo;re the wife for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>The seizure which overtook Susan Adlam on realising that Tom
Locke&rsquo;s mind was irrevocably made up would have thrilled
the whole village, had not the interest once evoked by her
uncommon delicacy of constitution been now entirely absorbed in
admiring contemplation of Tom Locke&rsquo;s artificial eye.&nbsp;
The fact of Susan Adlam&rsquo;s being subject to attacks of that
remarkable malady with the high-sounding name did, no doubt,
confer a certain distinction upon the neighbourhood; but what was
that compared with the lustre of having in their midst a man with
a removable eye?&nbsp; An eye that could be pocketed when not in
immediate use, and assumed at a moment&rsquo;s notice when it was
desired to create a favourable impression.</p>
<p>The new Mrs. Locke, being a thrifty soul, did not encourage
too frequent a use of this wonderful adornment; and, indeed, it
was universally felt that the spectacle would somewhat lose in
value if it were made too cheap.&nbsp; But little Lizzie, though
she was the humblest of her sex, felt a modest glow of pride when
she sat beside her <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>husband in the spring-cart; and on Sundays her devotion
was somewhat disturbed by the pleasant consciousness that, at
sermon time, the glances of the congregation wandered frequently
from the countenance of the preacher towards the preternaturally
alert orb of her Thomas.</p>
<h2><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>THE
ROSY PLATE.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Where thy
treasure is, there also is thy heart.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> old Maria Stickly had come
slowly hobbling down the narrow stairs each morning, and had
passed through the rickety door which admitted her into the
kitchen, her first glance was directed towards the plate which
occupied a prominent and central position on the topmost shelf of
the dresser.</p>
<p>Hands which had long since mouldered into dust had driven into
this shelf the two nails, rusty with age, which kept it from
slipping.&nbsp; Maria herself had, many, many years before,
constructed the little cloth pad which supported its upper rim;
and her first act after lighting the fire and sweeping the tiled
floor was to possess herself of this treasure, and carefully and
lovingly polish every inch of its already shining surface with a
soft cloth kept for the purpose.</p>
<p>This plate, the Rosy Plate, as Maria called <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>it, though,
in truth, the large crimson flower which sprawled over its centre
in the midst of foliage of a kind totally unknown to botanists
might just as well have been likened to a peony or a hollyhock,
had played a very important part in its owner&rsquo;s
career&mdash;in fact, it might have been called the arbiter of
her destiny.&nbsp; Maria used to tell the story sometimes when
her nearest neighbour, good-natured, overworked Mrs. Andrews, who
lived on the top of the hill a mile away, dropped in to rest on
her return home after a marketing expedition, the results of
which took up so much room in the perambulator that &ldquo;the
twin,&rdquo; a fine healthy pair of four-year-old boys, the
youngest of her family, had to take it by turns to walk.</p>
<p>Very hot and tired used poor Mrs. Andrews to be by the time
she reached this halting-place, very fractious were the children,
the pedestrian hanging on to his mother&rsquo;s skirts and
wailing intermittingly, while the proud occupant of the
&ldquo;pram&rdquo; kicked viciously at the parcels as they
encroached on the space usually allotted to his own fat little
legs, and uttered piercing shrieks when his exhausted mother
reproved him with certain admonitory but wholly innocuous
taps.&nbsp; No wonder that <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>at such times as these Mrs.
Stickly&rsquo;s little cottage appeared a very haven of rest, and
the sight of her kind old ruddy face peering out between the
geraniums in the little window was as welcome as the face of an
angel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk in, Mrs. Andrews, dear, do &rsquo;ee now,
an&rsquo; sit ye down.&nbsp; Tommy!&mdash;that bain&rsquo;t never
Tommy a-cryin&rsquo;, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; And here&rsquo;s
little Walter a-sittin&rsquo; so good in his pram, bless his
little &rsquo;eart&mdash;<i>he</i> wouldn&rsquo;t cry.&nbsp; Come
in, come in, and see what Mrs. Stickly have a-got ye.&nbsp; A
little bird did tell I as there was a slice o&rsquo; bread
an&rsquo; sugar in the cupboard for two good boys.&nbsp; I wonder
who they can be!&nbsp; Come in, Mrs. Andrews, an&rsquo; rest ye a
bit; I&rsquo;ve got the tea drawed all ready, down here in the
chimbley corner&mdash;he&rsquo;ll be nice and strong, for
he&rsquo;ve a-been made nigh half a hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis wonderful kind o&rsquo; you, Mrs.
Stickly,&rdquo; Mrs. Andrews would probably return, jamming the
pram into a convenient angle behind the door-post, and heaving a
weary sigh as she entered the cosy little kitchen.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis what I should never ha&rsquo; thought on,
I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; I should never ha&rsquo; looked for sich a
thing.&nbsp; But a cup o&rsquo; tea is a blessin&rsquo; when a
body have been so far as I&rsquo;ve been.&nbsp; Two lumps, if you
please&mdash;thank you&mdash;that&rsquo;ll do nice.&nbsp; Sit ye
<a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>down,
Tommy, and Walter, stand here quiet aside o&rsquo; me.&nbsp; If
you be good little boys, Mrs. Stickly &rsquo;ull maybe show you
the rosy plate afore we do go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Tommy and Walter would munch their bread-and-sugar in
blissful silence, and make themselves amazingly sticky, and stare
with all their might at the crimson-bedecked trophy which gleamed
down at them from its eminence on the dresser.&nbsp; And when
Mrs. Andrews had drunk her tea, and told her kind hostess all her
troubles&mdash;how her master was only working four days a week,
or how Teddie had got sore eyes, or how Susanna had an impression
on her chest, or, perhaps, how she herself had been that bad last
week with a sore throat that if anybody had comed to her
wi&rsquo; a cup o&rsquo; tea in one hand and a poker in the
other, she would have been forced to choose the poker; and when
Mrs. Stickly had duly groaned and shaken her head in sympathy,
the desire of the &ldquo;twin&rdquo; was acceded to, and the rosy
plate was carefully taken down and submitted to the admiring
inspection of the two pairs of round sloe-black eyes.</p>
<p>Mrs. Andrews well knew that this little ceremony caused quite
as much pleasure to <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>Mrs. Stickly as to the children, and
it was, perhaps, on this account chiefly that she asked for it,
and that, moreover, busy as she was, with a thousand odd jobs
waiting for her at home, she lingered a little longer in order to
hearken to the oft-told tale of the rosy plate, and of all that
it represented to its owner.&nbsp; Leaning back in Mrs.
Stickly&rsquo;s best chair with the patchwork cushion, and the
knitted antimacassar astride on its shiny wooden back, she would
fold her arms, heave a sigh of sentimental reminiscence, and
remark tentatively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, yes, Mrs. Stickly, they poor innocents
don&rsquo;t have no notion of all as that there pretty plate have
a-brought about.&nbsp; Nay, that they haven&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But ye
could tell a tale about that plate, couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee,
Mrs. Stickly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that I could,&rdquo; the old woman would say,
swallowing the bait eagerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;My poor husband, you
know&mdash;Stickly&mdash;he did give it I when first he was
a-coortin&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I think I&rsquo;ve heard you say,&rdquo; Mrs.
Andrews would return, with placid interest.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;d jist a-had a miff afore he give it
ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;E&mdash;es, we did have a bit of a miff that time; and
we shouldn&rsquo;t never ha&rsquo; made it up, I don&rsquo;t
think, if Stickly hadn&rsquo;t give me the rosy plate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did buy it for &rsquo;ee at Shroton, didn&rsquo;t <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>he?&rdquo;
Mrs. Andrews would say, needing perhaps to recall her hostess to
the present by some such reminder, for frequently, when talking
of these far-away times, Mrs. Stickly&rsquo;s faded blue eyes
would assume a dreamy look, and it would become evident that her
thoughts had strayed away from her interlocutrix to the bygone
days, when she was a handsome young lass, and Stickly and his
peers had come &ldquo;a-coortin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, he did buy it for I there&mdash;there was more nor
him did want to buy it for I.&nbsp; Dear heart alive, I can mind
it so well as if it were yesterday.&nbsp; I were reckoned a
good-lookin&rsquo; maid in those days&mdash;I did use to have a
very good colour, and my hair was curly and yollow&mdash;as
yollow as the corn, Stickly did say sometimes&mdash;and there was
a good many arter me one way and another.&nbsp; There was Tom
Boyt&mdash;a farmer&rsquo;s son <i>he</i> were&mdash;and there
was &rsquo;Neas Stuckhey&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; Mrs. Andrews occasionally murmured at
this moment, for the coincidence never failed to strike her,
&ldquo;Stuckhey and Stickly&mdash;the two names do sound very
much alike.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis odd how things do come
about&mdash;ye chose Stickly, and it mid jist as well ha&rsquo;
been Stuckhey.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>To
this profound remark Mrs. Stickly would probably assent, and
would then continue:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;E&mdash;es, a lot o&rsquo; us young folks did set off
for Shroton Fair that day.&nbsp; There was me, and Annie Boyt,
Tom&rsquo;s sister, and Rose Paddock; and there was Tom, and
&rsquo;Neas, and my John&mdash;that&rsquo;s Stickly, though I
didn&rsquo;t call him my John then&mdash;and a young man from
Shillingstone, whose name I can&rsquo;t mind at the present time,
but he was a-coortin&rsquo; of Annie.&nbsp; And as we did all
want to go together, Tom and Annie did persuade their father to
let &rsquo;em take one o&rsquo; his waggons; so we did have two
harses wi&rsquo; bells to their harness, and what wi&rsquo; the
bells, and what wi&rsquo; the maids singin&rsquo;, and the lads
shoutin&rsquo;, and the waggon rattlin&rsquo;, and the
harses&rsquo; feet a-hammerin&rsquo; the road, I can tell
&rsquo;ee we did make some noise as we was a-goin&rsquo;
along.&nbsp; The folks turned to look at us as we droved through
the villages, and the childern did run after us, and did cry out
&lsquo;Bring us a fairin&rsquo;, folks!&nbsp; Bring us a
fairin&rsquo; from Shroton!&rsquo;&nbsp; And Tom did
say&mdash;Tom was al&rsquo;ays free wi&rsquo; his money&mdash;he
did call out, &lsquo;Well, be good childern; we&rsquo;ll mayhap
bring you back a few ginger-nuts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we was the best o&rsquo; friends, an&rsquo; so
merry as ever we could be.&nbsp; I had a bonnet <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>lined
wi&rsquo; pink and a pink ribbon to tie it wi&rsquo;, and a pink
sash&mdash;folks did wear sashes then&mdash;and a frock&mdash;ah,
I can call to mind that frock!&nbsp; It were the purtiest I ever
did have in my life; there was little bunches o&rsquo; roses all
over it a-tied together wi&rsquo; knots o&rsquo; blue
ribbon&mdash;not real blue ribbon, ye know&mdash;&rsquo;twas just
the pattern on the stuff, but they was wonderful purty.&nbsp; My
mother did say to I when I was a-gettin&rsquo; it out,
&lsquo;Ye&rsquo;ll scarce be warm enough in that, Maria&rsquo;;
and I did say, &lsquo;Oh, e&mdash;es, mother, I&rsquo;ll be warm
enough&mdash;there be so many on us a-goin&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll
keep each other warm.&rsquo;&nbsp; And mother didn&rsquo;t say
nothin&rsquo;, but she just went to her box, and she did take out
her best shawl as she&rsquo;d been married in, and she did say,
&lsquo;There, my maid, &rsquo;ee can take that too; for thou art
a careful maid and won&rsquo;t let it come to harm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as I say, we was a merry crew!&nbsp; Dear heart
alive, that was we!&nbsp; There be times, Mrs. Andrews, when I be
sittin&rsquo; here so lonesome by the fire, an&rsquo; I do say to
myself, &lsquo;Was that really me&mdash;that vitty young maid!
(for I were reckoned a handsome maid in those days, Mrs. Andrews)
as rode in the big waggon that sunshiny day?&rsquo;&nbsp; Thinks
I to myself, &lsquo;It can never have been me&mdash;I <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>must
ha&rsquo; dreamed it&rsquo;; and then I do look up and see the
rosy plate shinin&rsquo; in the firelight, and I do say to
myself, &lsquo;Well, it were I, arter all&rsquo;; and it&rsquo;s
somethin&rsquo; to think as a body was once so young an&rsquo; so
merry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; her neighbour would agree.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But you was a-tellin&rsquo; me about the childern
a-runnin&rsquo; arter the waggon&mdash;I suppose it did not take
you so very long to get to Shroton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, we did get there early in the forenoon, and then
John did want me to go and see the harses jump, and the others
was all for goin&rsquo; straight off on the roundabouts.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll treat ye, Maria,&rsquo; says Tom.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And thank you kindly, Tom,&rsquo; says I.&nbsp; And then I
did turn round and see poor John a-lookin&rsquo; very
downhearted, so I did smile at en over my shoulder, and did say,
soft like, &lsquo;Do &rsquo;ee come, too, John.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; says John, very quiet.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I think not, Maria.&nbsp; Two be company, and three be
none, ye know.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, well,&rsquo; says I, just
to tease en, &lsquo;if you like to see your old harses
jumpin&rsquo; better nor to ride along of I, so ye may for all I
care.&nbsp; Which be the way, Tom?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee hear the music over
there?&rsquo; says Tom; but &rsquo;twas hard to hear
anythin&rsquo; the way the folks was a-talkin&rsquo; and
a-laughin&rsquo;; and what wi&rsquo; the shootin&rsquo;, and the
knockin&rsquo; <a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>down cocoa-nuts, and the roundabouts all
a-playin&rsquo; different tunes at the same time, and the showmen
shoutin&rsquo;, and the drums a-beatin&rsquo;, the noise was
enough to dather a body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Take my arm,&rsquo; says Tom; and Annie did pair
off with her young man, and Rose did catch hold o&rsquo;
&rsquo;Neas as bold as brass, though he looked a bit glum, I can
tell &rsquo;ee, for &rsquo;twere me as he wanted, d&rsquo;ye
see?&nbsp; And poor John were left all alone.&nbsp; I were
feelin&rsquo; vexed, I suppose, but now, when I do look back on
that day, it do seem to I as if I must ha&rsquo; been mad.&nbsp;
My mother &rsquo;ud ha&rsquo; scolded if she&rsquo;d a-known how
I did behave that day.&nbsp; First I did go in the roundabout
wi&rsquo; Tom, and then I did have another ride wi&rsquo;
&rsquo;Neas, and there was Rose a-lookin&rsquo; on very cross,
for Tom wouldn&rsquo;t treat her; and the crosser she did look
the more I did toss my head and laugh and talk wi&rsquo;
&rsquo;Neas, and then &rsquo;twas Tom&rsquo;s turn to pull a long
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then I did go wi&rsquo; Tom in the swings, and then
we did all have a game at Aunt Sally, and I did win; and
&rsquo;Neas gi&rsquo;ed me a bagful o&rsquo; ginger-nuts, and Tom
a box for pins, and Annie&rsquo;s young man come sidlin&rsquo; up
too, and says he, &lsquo;I must gi&rsquo;e ye something too, <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>Maria, for
I do think,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;as you be queen of the
fair&rsquo;.&nbsp; And he did buy me a lot o&rsquo; sticky sweet
stuff as I took one bite on and then dropped when he
weren&rsquo;t a-lookin&rsquo;.&nbsp; But ye should ha&rsquo; seed
Annie&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go and look
for John,&rsquo; says she, and her two eyes did shine much like
cat&rsquo;s eyes in the dark; but she didn&rsquo;t go arter John,
all the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we did come at last to one o&rsquo; the booths
where they were a-sellin&rsquo; china stuff: mugs, and vases, and
teapots, and cups, and plates, and as we stopped to look at
&rsquo;em the old woman as was a-sellin&rsquo; did hold up the
rosy plate, and says she to I, &lsquo;Do &rsquo;ee buy en, my
maid.&nbsp; The flowers be jist the same colour as they purty
cheeks o&rsquo; yourn.&nbsp; You be a real rose, for sure,&rsquo;
she did say, &lsquo;and you did ought to have the rosy
plate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put my hand in my pocket, and pulled out my
handkercher, for I&rsquo;d a-tied up my dibs in the corner.&nbsp;
My mother did gi&rsquo;e me eightpence to buy fairin&rsquo;s
wi&rsquo;, but I hadn&rsquo;t naught but a ha&rsquo;penny
left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all I have,&rsquo; says I,
holdin&rsquo; it up and laughin&rsquo;; &lsquo;will ye sell it me
for that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nay now,&rsquo; says the old woman; &lsquo;this
here plate do cost a shillin&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>&ldquo;Well, everybody knows, of course, as these here
folks do always ax twice so much as they&rsquo;re willin&rsquo;
to take; so Tom laughed, and says he:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come, I&rsquo;ll gi&rsquo;e ye sixpence for
&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; says &rsquo;Neas, steppin&rsquo; up,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m the man as must give the rose o&rsquo; Shroton
Fair the rosy plate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Rose Paddock did begin to smile and to smirk, and to
think it were she as he meant; but I knowed very well it were
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The rose o&rsquo; the fair,&rsquo; says
&rsquo;Neas, &lsquo;must have a rosy plate for to match the roses
on her cheeks and the roses on her frock.&rsquo;&nbsp; And poor
Rose did look sour, for her frock was brown all over, wi&rsquo;
jist a bunch o&rsquo; blue ribbons at the neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll gi&rsquo;e ye eightpence for the rosy
plate,&rsquo; says &rsquo;Neas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, let me have it for tenpence!&rsquo; hollers
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo; A shillin&rsquo;!&rsquo; says Annie&rsquo;s
young man all of a sudden; it did really seem, Mrs. Andrews, as
if he couldn&rsquo;t hold back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Eighteenpence!&rsquo; says &rsquo;Neas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Two shillin&rsquo;!&rsquo; cries Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tch, tch, tch,&rdquo; commented Mrs. Andrews, clicking
her tongue in amazed condemnation <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>of such wanton extravagance, though
she knew quite as well as Mrs. Stickly what was coming next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll believe me,&rdquo; said Maria
triumphantly, &ldquo;they did run up the price o&rsquo; that
there plate to five shillin&rsquo; before they&rsquo;d
done!&nbsp; Five shillin&rsquo;!&nbsp; That were Tom&rsquo;s bid;
and &rsquo;Neas, he did laugh and shake his head and say,
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis half my week&rsquo;s wages&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
go no further, Maria; ye must take the will for the
deed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annie&rsquo;s young man had dropped off some time
before, so now the plate were knocked down to Tom; and he did put
his hand in his pocket like a lord and pull out his money.&nbsp;
But when he did come to count it there weren&rsquo;t above
four-and-sixpence all together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lend me sixpence, somebody,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank &rsquo;ee for nothin&rsquo;,&rsquo; says
&rsquo;Neas; &lsquo;if it be goin&rsquo; for four-and-sixpence
I&rsquo;ll have it myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m sure I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
lend you sixpence, Tom,&rsquo; says Annie&rsquo;s young
man.&nbsp; &lsquo;It be simple waste to gi&rsquo;e so much for
that there plate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, &rsquo;tis a deal o&rsquo; money,
surely,&rsquo; says Tom.&nbsp; Folks were a-gatherin&rsquo;
round, d&rsquo;ye see, and starin&rsquo;, and laughin&rsquo;, and
nudgin&rsquo; of each other, and Tom began to feel he were
lookin&rsquo; a fool.</p>
<p><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;ll be naught left for a bit
o&rsquo; nuncheon,&rsquo; says he, half to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, pray don&rsquo;t waste your money on
I,&rsquo; says I, and the tears did spring to my eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s true, too,&rsquo; said &rsquo;Neas
to Tom, &lsquo;we ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t had a bite yet, nor so much
as a glass o&rsquo; beer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looked as if I were not a-goin&rsquo; to have my
plate at all, though they&rsquo;d all been fightin&rsquo; who was
a-goin&rsquo; to give it to I.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure my cheeks was
redder than any roses could be, as I stood listenin&rsquo; to
&rsquo;em; and all at once I raised my eyes, and there was John
lookin&rsquo; across at me.&nbsp; And then I did feel myself go
pale, and my head did begin to go round and round, I were that
ashamed o&rsquo; myself and of all as had been goin&rsquo;
on.&nbsp; But the next thing I did hear was John&rsquo;s
voice:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Five shillin&rsquo;, did ye say?&nbsp; There it
is; I&rsquo;ll take it.&rsquo;&nbsp; And in another minute
he&rsquo;d a-put the plate in my hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There it be, my maid,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t think it too much to give since you fancy
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well done!&rsquo; cries the folks; &lsquo;here
be the right man at last, &rsquo;tis the proper spirit for a
lover.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then they began to clap en on the back,
and to laugh, and wish him well, and ax him when the
weddin&rsquo; was to be, <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>and I don&rsquo;t know what
besides.&nbsp; I did scarce know which way to look, I were that
ashamed, and yet that pleased; and John he did pull my hand
through his arm, and he did lead I out of the row of booths, and
away from the crowd, till we come to a quiet corner of the big
field, and there we did sit down, and he did say, smilin&rsquo;
like:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Next year ye&rsquo;ll come to see the harses
wi&rsquo; me, Maria?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;E&mdash;es,&rsquo; said I, hanging down my head;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go wherever ye ax me, John.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then will ye come to church wi&rsquo; me, my
maid?&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;will ye be my wife,
Maria?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that were how we did make it up between us; and he
did al&rsquo;ays say as it were the rosy plate as done it.&nbsp;
We were wed before the year were out, and the first thing Stickly
did do was to make a place for that there plate upon the
dresser.&nbsp; And as years went by and the childern come, he
used to lift &rsquo;em up to see it.&nbsp; Each did have leave to
eat out of it on its birthday&mdash;we did use to put a little
bit o&rsquo; cake upon the rosy plate, and set it by the birthday
child; and ye should ha&rsquo; seen how j&rsquo;yful it would
look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, sure,&rdquo; commented Mrs. Andrews.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twould be nice to have a bit o&rsquo; cake on <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>sich a
beautiful plate, wouldn&rsquo;t it, Walter?&nbsp; That &rsquo;ud
be a nice birthday treat for any little boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do often mind me o&rsquo; them days,&rdquo; Mrs.
Stickly resumed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear, yes!&nbsp; I do often think I
hear the little voices and the little feet, and see
father&mdash;that&rsquo;s Stickly&mdash;a-liftin&rsquo; up the
youngest un to look at the plate.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis very near like
a book to me, that plate.&nbsp; I mid ha&rsquo; wrote in it all
the joys and sorrows o&rsquo; my life&mdash;what I&rsquo;ve a-had
and what I&rsquo;ve a-lost&mdash;I do mind &rsquo;em all when I
look at it.&nbsp; Mary, the only maid I had, did cut her
weddin&rsquo; cake on this here plate&mdash;she was a vitty
bride&mdash;but she died wi&rsquo; her first baby; an&rsquo; John
did &rsquo;list for a soldier, and were killed out abroad, and
James and &rsquo;Lias died o&rsquo; the fever when they was quite
little.&nbsp; E&mdash;es, I did lose &rsquo;em all; me and
Stickly was a-left alone by the fire in the end, and now there be
nobody but I.&nbsp; They be all a-gone before I to the New
House.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll jine &rsquo;em there some day, Mrs.
Andrews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Mrs. Andrews would agree and condole, and begin to
think it was time for her to move; and Tommy and Walter would
have their mufflers tied round their necks, and the party would
start off homewards, while <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>Mrs. Stickly, with a sigh and a
smile, would restore the rosy plate to its place.</p>
<p>The little house at the hill-foot occupied, as has been said,
a somewhat solitary position, being a mile from any other
habitation; but it never seemed to occur to any one that in the
case of illness or accident its owner would find herself in a
somewhat sorry plight.</p>
<p>When in the middle of a bright, frosty, wintry night,
therefore, Mrs. Andrews was awakened by a loud knocking at her
door and piteous cries for help, and when, on throwing open her
casement and leaning out, she recognised the small figure
standing on her threshold as Mrs. Stickly, her astonishment was
mingled with some measure of indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness gracious, Mrs. Stickly, whatever brings you
here at this time o&rsquo; night?&mdash;I be frightened out
o&rsquo; my wits!&nbsp; Has anything happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world be amiss?&rdquo; inquired the deep
tones of Mr. Andrews from under the bed-clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come down, come down, good folks, for pity&rsquo;s
sake!&rdquo; wailed the nocturnal visitor; &ldquo;my house be
a-fire&mdash;&rsquo;tis a mercy I weren&rsquo;t burnt in my
bed!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>&ldquo;Your house a-fire!&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Andrews in
genuine concern; and thereupon ensued the hasty thud of Mr.
Andrews&rsquo; bare feet upon the floor.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
let you in in a minute!&nbsp; Dear heart alive! what a
misfortune, to be sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another moment her hospitable but scantily clad figure
appeared in the doorway, and a kind, warm hand drew the
shivering, sobbing little figure to the kitchen within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye be as cold as any stone,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee cry so, Mrs. Stickly dear, Andrews
&rsquo;ull be down in a minute, and I&rsquo;ll call Mr. Butt,
next door, and a few more chaps&mdash;they&rsquo;ll soon put it
out!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee fret so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Andrews,&rdquo; gasped the poor old woman,
&ldquo;it be all blazin&rsquo; and roarin&rsquo;&mdash;the roof
be all a-fire!&nbsp; I think it must ha&rsquo; been a spark lit
on it.&nbsp; It were that cold, d&rsquo;ye see, I&rsquo;d made me
up a good fire to warm me before I went to bed&mdash;I had some
nice logs, and I think a spark from &rsquo;em must have lit upon
the roof.&nbsp; I woke up chokin&rsquo;, and couldn&rsquo;t see
wi&rsquo; the smoke, but I dressed and ran downstairs so fast as
I could, and there were more smoke in the kitchen.&nbsp; I could
scarce find my way to the dresser, but I crope about until I got
there, and ketched hold of the rosy plate, and then out I
ran.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>By
this time Mr. Andrews had joined them, and soon a little relief
party was organised, and set off with all speed to the scene of
the disaster; but long before they reached the spot the would-be
rescuers agreed that the task was hopeless.&nbsp; The old thatch
was now one sheet of flame; every window of the little dwelling
was defined in fire; the crackling of the crazy woodwork and the
roar of the blaze could be heard almost half a mile away.&nbsp;
The men halted and looked at each other blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ten to one if there&rsquo;s a drap o&rsquo;
water handy at this time o&rsquo; night,&rdquo; said Abel Butt,
putting into words the thought which was, indeed, present in the
minds of all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Stickly did say as her well was froze,&rdquo;
observed Andrews gloomily; &ldquo;but we&rsquo;d best go on all
the same and see what can be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went forward again, but more slowly, and in
silence.&nbsp; Before they reached the house, however, the roof
fell in with a crash and a roar, wrecking the little home it once
had sheltered.</p>
<p>For some weeks Maria was prostrated by the shock.&nbsp; Mrs.
Andrews did all she could for her, but as time went on the
question of ways and means became a serious one.&nbsp; <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>Andrews was
not in full work that winter, and there were many little mouths
to feed, and, moreover, the anticipated arrival of a successor to
the &ldquo;twin&rdquo; would shortly incapacitate Mrs. Andrews
from attending to her helpless charge.&nbsp; All poor old
Maria&rsquo;s household gods had perished in the flames; she had
already for some years been in the receipt of outdoor relief from
the parish, on which, together with the produce of her garden,
and the eggs laid by her hens, she had hitherto contrived to
live.&nbsp; But now, what was to be done?&nbsp; The cottage was
burnt to the ground, and the landlord, though kind and tolerant
with regard to certain arrears of rent, was not inclined to
rebuild it; moreover, it would be dangerous for Maria in her
enfeebled state to resume her former solitary life.</p>
<p>Much anxious consultation on the part of friends and
well-wishers resulted in the halting one day outside Mrs.
Andrews&rsquo; door of a cab, from which descended a neat,
bright-eyed little woman in the uniform of a hospital
nurse.&nbsp; It was, indeed, no other than the district nurse
from the town of Branston, who, at the request of the
authorities, had undertaken to escort Maria to the Union.</p>
<p>Mrs. Andrews met her on the doorstep.</p>
<p><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got her ready,&rdquo; she said, in an
agitated whisper.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s dressed all but her
bonnet and shawl, and they&rsquo;re quite handy, but I
haven&rsquo;t had the heart to tell her yet.&nbsp; It do seem
hard for a poor old body.&nbsp; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low it&rsquo;s
cruel hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want me to tell her, in fact,&rdquo; said the
nurse.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, it all comes in the day&rsquo;s work, I
suppose, and we can&rsquo;t keep the cab waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went into the kitchen, and sat down by the small shrunken
figure in the elbow-chair.&nbsp; Unpleasant tasks had frequently
fallen to Nurse Margaret&rsquo;s lot during the course of her
professional career: she had had to announce impending
bereavement to many an anxious family; she had not infrequently
given a truthful answer to those patients who, already in the
death-throes, had asked if their end were near; but never yet had
she been called upon to perform a duty so painful as that of
making this honest, decent, gentle, little old woman realise that
she was to end her days in the workhouse.</p>
<p>She did realise it, though.&nbsp; Nurse Margaret saw the
wrinkled face blanch, and the mouth quiver, and the eyes grow
wide with horror and alarm; and then, just as she was preparing
for an outburst of tears and protests, she saw, <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>to her
surprise, the poor old creature brace herself, and presently the
answer came, given with a certain quiet dignity:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Miss, I&rsquo;ll come.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wish
to be a burden to nobody.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twon&rsquo;t be for long,
very like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Andrews came out of her entrenchment behind the door, and
tied on Maria&rsquo;s bonnet and shawl, with many tears and
inarticulate apologies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee take on, my dear,&rdquo; said
Maria, with the same gentle dignity.&nbsp; &ldquo;It bain&rsquo;t
none o&rsquo; your fault.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very thankful to ye for
what you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m over my trouble I&rsquo;ll come to see
you,&rdquo; gasped the good hostess, whose face was glazed with
ineffectual grief.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll&mdash;they&rsquo;ll
take good care of ye there, I&rsquo;m told; and maybe better
times will come, and we can get &rsquo;ee out again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria smiled; she knew very well that she would never come out
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could wish,&rdquo; she said presently, &ldquo;I had
some little things to give the childern, Mrs. Andrews, but
I&rsquo;ve nought in the wide world but the clothes on my back,
and the rosy plate&mdash;and that I can never part with so long
as I live.&nbsp; Give it to me,&rdquo; she said, after a <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>pause,
pointing to where her treasure lay safely ensconced in a drawer
of the chest in the corner.</p>
<p>Mrs. Andrews produced it, but, as she crossed the kitchen
towards her friend, Nurse Margaret looked at her meaningly, and
slowly shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid they won&rsquo;t let her keep
it,&rdquo; she said, under her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twill fair break her heart if they
don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; whispered the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
&rsquo;ee try an&rsquo; persuade &rsquo;em, Miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nurse shook her head again, but promised to try; and then
Maria was slowly hoisted from her chair, and supported across the
kitchen and into the cab.&nbsp; She returned Mrs. Andrews&rsquo;
farewell embrace, and sat looking before her vacantly as the cab
drove away.</p>
<p>Nurse Margaret&rsquo;s surmise proved only too correct; those
who passed through the stony portals of the Union found
themselves as completely denuded of this world&rsquo;s gear as
though those gates had been in very truth the Gates of
Death.&nbsp; Maria possessed a comfortable warm shawl, with which
she was accustomed to envelop her chilly old frame when in bed;
but she was informed that she could not be allowed to keep
it.</p>
<p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>When
this shawl and her warm clothes were taken away from her, and she
was clad in the regulation garments, she was told that probably
in a week or so a kind lady who visited the Union would knit her
a shawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But mine be quite good,&rdquo; said Maria,
feebly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low I&rsquo;d rather have
my own.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t be the same.&nbsp; My own
shawl, d&rsquo;ye see&mdash;&rdquo; she broke off suddenly, her
lip trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hers is quite clean,&rdquo; said Nurse Margaret:
&ldquo;could she not be allowed to have it?&rdquo;&nbsp; Possibly
she realised something of what was passing in Maria&rsquo;s mind:
a lingering sense of personal dignity&mdash;the last vestige of
proud independence; the natural clinging, almost childish in its
tenacity, to what was her &ldquo;very own&rdquo;.&nbsp; Perhaps
there were associations connected with that shawl that made it
doubly precious; it might have been an heirloom, it might have
been a gift&mdash;even if purchased only by the wearer herself
out of long and carefully hoarded savings, how much would such a
fact add to its value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite impossible,&rdquo; returned the matron with
decision.&nbsp; &ldquo;We cannot make an exception.&nbsp; They
would all want to wear their own dirty, fusty things and there
would be no end <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>to it.&nbsp; But everything will he taken good care of,
and given back to her when she leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is seventy-five now,&rdquo; said Nurse
Margaret.&nbsp; &ldquo;She has not a friend in the world, nor, I
believe, a penny.&nbsp; I am afraid it is not very likely that
better times will come for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria had listened to this colloquy in a dazed, stupid way,
and made no attempt to speak again until her precious plate was
taken away from her, when she broke into clamorous
protestations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t ax me to part wi&rsquo; the
rosy plate!&nbsp; It be all as I&rsquo;ve a-left in the
world.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll not take no room&mdash;I can jist keep
it under my piller, and nobody &rsquo;ull know it be there.&nbsp;
Do &rsquo;ee now, ma&rsquo;am, do &rsquo;ee let me keep
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But again she was confronted with those terrible rules; and
she was led away, weeping bitterly, to her new quarters.</p>
<p>She found herself in the company of some twenty old women in a
large whitewashed room.&nbsp; Some were knitting, some were
sewing, one dandling a hapless six-months-old baby, whose mother
was at work in some other part of the establishment.</p>
<p>Maria sat down on the edge of the bed that was allotted to
her, and looked vacantly round; <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>one or two of the women spoke to
her, but she scarcely heeded them.</p>
<p>A big bell clanged out presently, and she was told that it was
for tea, and feebly followed in the wake of her companions, as
they went trooping down a flagged passage and into a large room
with a long table running down its centre&mdash;a bare deal table
with benches on either side, each place being marked by a tin mug
and a hunch of bread, on the top of which was laid a lump of
butter or cheese.</p>
<p>Maria&rsquo;s right-hand neighbour instantly began to spread
her butter with her thumb.&nbsp; The younger woman on her left
took alternate mouthfuls from the cheese and the bread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bain&rsquo;t there no knives nor plates?&rdquo;
inquired Maria, suddenly awaking to the fact of their
absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see for yourself there
bain&rsquo;t?&rdquo; was the response.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
best begin&mdash;they don&rsquo;t give us so very
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why bain&rsquo;t there no plates?&rdquo; persisted
Maria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it matter about plates?&rdquo; grumbled the
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be willin&rsquo; enough to do
wi&rsquo;out plates&mdash;&rsquo;tis the food as I mind.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve got butter&mdash;all the old folks have that, <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>but they
chuck us younger ones a bit o&rsquo; cheese as hard as a paving
stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria looked at her lump of bread with its triangular portion
of butter set forth on the bare board, and wept.&nbsp; This was
what she had come to, she, Maria Stickly, who had always
throughout her long, honest, struggling life held up her head
with the best!&nbsp; She bowed it now on her poor sunken chest,
and sobbed aloud.</p>
<p>A long skinny hand presently hovered over her discarded
portion, and her elder neighbour said, with a titter and a
cunning look:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If &rsquo;ee don&rsquo;t want it, ye&rsquo;ll
p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps have no objection to my taking of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And on its owner making no sign the transfer speedily took
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay now, that bain&rsquo;t fair!&rdquo; whispered the
woman on the other side, angrily; &ldquo;I claim half.&nbsp; Her
and me was a-speaking together first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They began to quarrel over the food, while Maria sobbed on
between them; the sight of their inflamed faces and the sound of
their angry, coarse words seemed to her to aggravate the
indignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The food be thrown down to us like dogs,&rdquo; she
said to herself, &ldquo;an&rsquo; they be a-fightin&rsquo; over
it like dogs!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>Presently the altercation attracted the attention of
some one in authority, and the matter was inquired into, the fact
being elicited that the new-comer had disdained her appointed
portion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t never been used to take my meals
wi&rsquo;out no plate!&rdquo; she protested with a burst of woe,
for her outraged self-respect gave her courage.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There must be plates here&mdash;folks couldn&rsquo;t eat
their dinner wi&rsquo;out no plates, and if &rsquo;tis along
o&rsquo; the washin&rsquo; up, there be a-many women here as
could do it; I&rsquo;d do it myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she was told not to give herself such airs.&nbsp; When
people came to the Union they mustn&rsquo;t be so
particular&mdash;she must be content to do as others did.&nbsp;
Plates indeed! there were no plates there, not even coffin
plates!</p>
<p>This joke was duly appreciated, but it fell on poor old
Maria&rsquo;s bewildered ears with an ominous sound, as it were a
knell of final doom. &ldquo;Not even coffin plates!&rdquo; she
murmured to herself; and her tears ceased falling, and she sat
gazing vaguely at the wrinkled hands clasped in her lap.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not even coffin plates!&rdquo;&nbsp; Her actual misery had
hitherto prevented her from dwelling on that last inevitable end,
but now it seemed to stare her in the face.&nbsp; <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>A
pauper&rsquo;s grave&mdash;that was what awaited her, as surely
as death itself.</p>
<p>She passed the next few days in a sort of dream of anguish,
hardly taking note of her surroundings; conforming, however, to
the rules of the establishment, and eating, or trying to eat, the
food allotted to her without further complaint or comment.&nbsp;
One morning, however, on endeavouring to rise, she fell sideways
against her bed and fainted away.</p>
<p>When she recovered consciousness she found herself in a
different part of the house, in the infirmary, indeed, and a
nurse was supporting her, and the doctor stood by her bed.&nbsp;
As her dim eyes fixed themselves upon his face she recognised
him: it was her own doctor; he had attended her&mdash;being a
young man then&mdash;when James was born, and he had done his
best for Stickly in his last illness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mrs. Stickly,&rdquo; he said cheerily, &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t expect to meet an old friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Maria faintly, and the dim eyes
grew still more dim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, they will take good care of you
here&mdash;you will not want for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria&rsquo;s lip trembled, but she said nothing; she followed
the doctor appealingly with her eyes as he moved about the
room.</p>
<p><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>&ldquo;Poor old soul,&rdquo; he said to the nurse,
after meeting this piteous gaze, &ldquo;she is eating out her
heart here, but it won&rsquo;t be for long&mdash;do all you can
for her, nurse; she is breaking up fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman did not catch the words, but she saw the
compassionate glance, and observed the infirmarian&rsquo;s eyes
directed towards her with a certain amount of
interest&mdash;merely professional interest if she had but known
it&mdash;and all at once a project took shape in her mind.&nbsp;
If she asked for the rosy plate now, perhaps they would not
refuse her.</p>
<p>When the nurse inquired later on if she wished for anything,
she took courage to proffer her petition, very feebly and
incoherently.&nbsp; There was a plate, a plate which belonged to
her, the rosy plate as she called it; the lady kept it: the lady
what lived in the room downstairs.&nbsp; Would the nurse ask if
she might have it&mdash;this in a strained and tremulous
whisper&mdash;she would keep it under her bed-clothes and no one
should see, but if she might just have it.</p>
<p>The nurse demurred, but good-naturedly, patting her pillows
the while.&nbsp; The matron, perhaps, would not be very well
pleased if it <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>were asked for; it was a little difficult to ask her to
break the rules; and, after all, the plate couldn&rsquo;t do
Maria much good if it was to be kept under the bed-clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, it would,&rdquo; pleaded Maria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, go to sleep, and we&rsquo;ll see about it
in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when the morning came the nurse was busy; and in the
afternoon the matron was out.&nbsp; Thus, on one pretext or
another, the realisation of the poor old woman&rsquo;s desire was
perpetually postponed; and meanwhile she herself grew hourly
weaker.&nbsp; The feeble voice continued to falter her request
whenever the nurse came near her bed, and when she moved away
Maria&rsquo;s pathetic gaze followed her, until the heavy lids
dropped over the weary eyes, and she forgot for a little while
her unfulfilled longing.</p>
<p>Once, on opening her eyes after one of these brief spells of
slumber, she saw the doctor&rsquo;s kind, familiar face looking
down at her.&nbsp; His voice had penetrated faintly to her inner
consciousness before she had felt equal to the task of raising
her lids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sinking fast!&rdquo;&mdash;these were the words that
had fallen upon her ears.</p>
<p>With the opening of Maria&rsquo;s eyes there <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>had leaped
into them the appeal which during her waking moments was never
absent from them.&nbsp; The doctor bent over her kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants something, poor old soul,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is it, Mrs. Stickly?&nbsp; What can we do
for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria&rsquo;s cold, feeble hands came suddenly out from under
the bed-clothes, and closed round one of his: she rallied all her
strength, and raised herself a little; a light flickered for a
moment in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want my plate,&rdquo; she gasped:
&ldquo;they&rsquo;ve took away&mdash;my rosy plate&mdash;and they
won&rsquo;t give it back to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to be sure, she&rsquo;s at that old plate
again,&rdquo; said the nurse; and she began, half vexed and half
laughing, to relate the story to the doctor.</p>
<p>Maria had fallen back on her pillows, but she still clung
desperately to the doctor&rsquo;s hand, and her gaze never left
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want my plate,&rdquo; she repeated, when the nurse
paused.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do &rsquo;ee&mdash;ax &rsquo;em to give it
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor withdrew his hand, but very gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of heaven,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;give <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>the poor
old creature her plate!&nbsp; She hasn&rsquo;t many hours to
live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so Maria&rsquo;s last desperate appeal succeeded, and the
doctor smiled as he saw how eagerly she hugged it to her withered
bosom.&nbsp; He did not know that it represented for her Home,
and all it had held of sweetness; that clasping it she possessed
once more Youth, and Love, and Hope.</p>
<p>Once more he bent over her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right now, Maria, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria smiled, and a new thought seemed to strike her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; she said feebly, but confidently too,
&ldquo;will &rsquo;ee ax &rsquo;em to put it in my
coffin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As dawn drew nigh the night nurse paused near Maria&rsquo;s
bed, then, coming closer, bent over it, then, turning up the
light, bent lower still.&nbsp; Straightening herself after a
moment&rsquo;s pause, she drew up the sheet softly over the old
woman&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>But the thin arms beneath were folded close and the face wore
a smile of bliss and peace, such as it might have worn more than
half a century before, when, as a young mother, she had clasped
her first-born to her breast.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>&ldquo;So she&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; said the
doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, what did you do about the
plate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nurse laughed, and twisted her apron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems a silly thing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but
there! it was the last thing she asked me, and I someway felt I
had to do it.&nbsp; I put it in her coffin.&rdquo;</p>

175</span>BECKY AND BITHEY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">No</span> pleasanter place than Mrs.
Meatyard&rsquo;s dairy was to be found at any hour of the
summer&rsquo;s day; but it was a busy place too.&nbsp; At early
dawn the clatter of bright cans and the lowing of cows in the
adjacent yard announced milking time, and men came staggering in
with great foaming pails of milk and poured it, sweet and warm,
into the shallow tins prepared for it.&nbsp; A little later
mistress and maid alike were busy skimming the thick folds of
last night&rsquo;s cream.&nbsp; On churning days the regular
<i>splash</i>, <i>splash</i> in the outer milk-house was the
forerunner of the pleasant labour of butter-making.&nbsp; On
cheese days the huge vat had to be filled with gallons and
gallons of milk, and then the rennet carefully measured out, and
then Mrs. Meatyard and Rebecca took it in turns to
&ldquo;work&rdquo; the curds; and what with this working, and
putting the curds into presses, and running off the whey, and
cleaning up afterwards, a body, as Rebecca <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>frequently
said, would be better off with four pair of hands nor with
one.</p>
<p>Nevertheless there was something cheerful and delightful even
to the workers about the bustle and stir&mdash;the sight of the
rich milk, the faintly sour smell of the curds, the pure, sweet
air that circled round hot faces through the wide open door, the
little shifting lights and shades that played about shining tins
and whitewashed walls as the branches of the trees that
surrounded the house were set dancing in the wind.&nbsp; Yes,
Thorncombe Dairy was a pleasant place, and never more so than on
this particular June afternoon, when the roses outside the
milk-house door were in full bloom, and the sweet odours of the
old-fashioned flowers in the borders beneath the windows came
floating in to mingle with the homelier scents within.</p>
<p>Mrs. Meatyard had duly &ldquo;cleaned herself&rdquo; and
changed her dress, and now, with the cuffs of her stuff gown
turned up, was delicately enswathing roll after roll of golden
butter in small squares of gauze, and packing them, when thus
protected, in baskets ready for to-morrow&rsquo;s market.&nbsp;
Old Rebecca was busy at the other end with scrubbing-brush and
pail, &ldquo;swilling down&rdquo; the shelves.&nbsp; Her spare <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>form was
encased in a somewhat faded cotton garment, the sleeves of which
were rolled up high; the sparse wisps of her grey hair were
ruffled and untidy, but her ruddy, wrinkled old face was cheery
and good-tempered, and she crooned a song to herself as she
scrubbed the boards.</p>
<p>In the outer milk-house one of the labourers was also at work
cleaning up, hissing as he used the broom as though he were
rubbing down a horse, and every now and then making a great
clatter with the piled-up cans.</p>
<p>Through the open door the imposing form of the
&ldquo;master&rdquo; could be seen leaning over the gate which
opened into the farmyard, contemplating the operations of two of
the farm hands who were engaged in cleaning an outhouse.&nbsp; On
the cobble-stones near his feet pigeons were strutting up and
down, bowing and cooing; a little group of calves lay sunning
themselves in a corner of the yard, flapping their ears and
waving their tails as the flies teased them.&nbsp; Cocks and hens
were crowing and clucking, pigs were grunting, sheep and lambs in
the pasture behind the house were bleating, bees in the
lime-blossom were humming, and throughout <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>all the din
of outdoor life Rebecca&rsquo;s quavering, voice could be plainly
heard:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>For Do&rsquo;set dear<br />
Then gi&rsquo;e woone cheer;<br />
D&rsquo;ye hear?&nbsp; Woone cheer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But louder even than her ditty sounded all at once a shrill,
tuneful whistle, and the head of a young man came presently in
sight, moving rapidly along the irregular line of hedge that
divided the farm premises from the lane; and presently the owner
of the head rounded the corner and entered the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis you, Charl&rsquo;?&rdquo; observed Farmer
Meatyard, without removing his pipe from his mouth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You be come in nice time to fetch cows up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jist what I was a-thinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said
Charl&rsquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was kept a bit longer in town nor I
looked for, but I did hear sich a funny bit o&rsquo;
noos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did &rsquo;ee now?&rdquo; inquired his father, much
interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ees, I do &rsquo;low I did.&nbsp; That there new
show as they be all a-talkin&rsquo; about&mdash;the Agricultural
Show they calls it&mdash;ye wouldn&rsquo;t never think what they
be goin&rsquo; to give a prize for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I did hear, all sarts,&rdquo; returned the father
a trifle impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Harses and <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>cattle and
pigs, and cheese and butter&mdash;all they kind o&rsquo;
things.&nbsp; There bain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; so very wonderful
i&rsquo; that.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis much same as other
shows&mdash;voolish work, I reckon it.&nbsp; Ye mid have the best
harse, or the best milkin&rsquo; cow in the countryside, and yet
they wouldn&rsquo;t give en a prize.&nbsp; Nay, they&rsquo;d
sooner gi&rsquo;e it to some strange beast from Bourne or
Templecombe or some sich place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but ye haven&rsquo;t heard my tale yet,&rdquo;
cried the son.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jist you try to guess the last thing
as I&rsquo;ve heared they be a-goin&rsquo; to give a prize
for.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis somethin&rsquo;
livin&rsquo;&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell &rsquo;ee that much, and it
isn&rsquo;t neither a harse nor a cow, nor a pig, nor anything as
ye&rsquo;d think likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bull?&rdquo; suggested Farmer Meatyard, who was not
an imaginative man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay now; when I said a cow I meant male or
faymale.&nbsp; It bain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; that kind,
nor yet cocks and hens.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;ll never
guess&mdash;&rsquo;tis the queerest thing!&nbsp; Call Mother, and
let her see if she can have a shot at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, Missus!&rdquo; shouted the farmer
excitedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come here and give your opinion.&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s Charl&rsquo; come back from town, and he do say they
be a-goin&rsquo; to give a prize at this &rsquo;ere noo Show as
is a-comin&rsquo; off next <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>month for summat altogether out
o&rsquo; the common.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis alive, he says, but
&rsquo;tis neither bird nor beast as I can hear of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meatyard, folding her
hands at her waist, and looking out of the rose-framed milk-house
door with placid interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now&mdash;I have
it!&nbsp; Bees!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; Bless you, Mother, there bain&rsquo;t
nothin&rsquo; wonderful nor yet funny about bees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear heart alive, what a tease the lad be!&nbsp; Is it
a handsome thing, Charl&rsquo;, or an oncommon thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis neither one nor t&rsquo;other,&rdquo;
replied Charl&rsquo;, exploding with laughter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There, I&rsquo;d best tell you, for you&rsquo;d never
guess.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a wold &rsquo;ooman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, get away, do!&rdquo; growled his father, much
disgusted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee go for to tell I
sich cock-and-bull stories.&nbsp; A wold
&rsquo;ooman&mdash;who&rsquo;d go for to give a prize for sich as
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis true, though,&rdquo; retorted Charl&rsquo;,
&ldquo;&rsquo;twas in every one&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; A prize,
they do say, will be given for the woldest faymale farm
servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to be sure,&rdquo; ejaculated his mother,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard o&rsquo; prizes bein&rsquo; give for the
finest baby, and somebody did tell I once about a prize
bein&rsquo; give for the beautifullest young <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>girl, but I
never did hear o&rsquo; givin&rsquo; prizes for wold
folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t raysonable, I don&rsquo;t
think,&rdquo; commented her lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, it do seem a
foolish kind o&rsquo; notion.&nbsp; Why, if they do go
encouragin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the wold hags that way, they&rsquo;ll
live for ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Meatyard,
disregarding him, &ldquo;if our Rebecca didn&rsquo;t have so good
a chance as any one.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a good age, Rebecca
is.&nbsp; Ah, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder a bit if Rebecca was to
get it.&nbsp; I think she is the woldest woman in these parts,
without it&rsquo;s Mr. Sharp&rsquo;s Bithey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Becky!&rdquo; screamed Charl&rsquo; ecstatically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Becky!&nbsp; Come here a minute.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve brought
some good news for &rsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Becky came to the door, wiping her soapy arms with her coarse
apron, and smiling pleasantly if toothlessly at the young man,
who was a favourite with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Becky,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;how would &rsquo;ee like
for to win a prize at the new Show what&rsquo;s to be given in
the Royal George&rsquo;s grounds next month?&nbsp; There, Mother
thinks you have got so good a chance as any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did hear as they was a-goin&rsquo; to give a prize
for butter,&rdquo; said Rebecca; &ldquo;but all as comes out of
this &rsquo;ere house be Missus&rsquo;s <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>makin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t never no great hand
at it.&nbsp; Nay, I can milk and skim and churn right enough; but
I haven&rsquo;t Missus&rsquo;s hand on butter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It bain&rsquo;t the butter prize as I mean,&rdquo;
cried Charl&rsquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;They be a-goin&rsquo; to give a
prize for the woldest &rsquo;ooman-servant.&nbsp; I heared it
wi&rsquo; my own ears, and the prize is to be a butter-dish, and
you&rsquo;ve just so good a right to it, Becky, as any
other.&nbsp; Better!&nbsp; For I don&rsquo;t believe
there&rsquo;s sich another old witch in the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re an impident chap, Charl&rsquo;,&rdquo;
cried Rebecca, somewhat offended.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
to listen to sich a pack of rubbish!&nbsp; There, I&rsquo;ve
a-got summat else to do.&nbsp; Ye mid keep a civil tongue in yer
head, I think.&nbsp; Witch, says he!&nbsp; Tell him to go and
drive cows up, Master, else we shan&rsquo;t get through with our
work this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and drive cows up right enough,&rdquo;
said the youth; &ldquo;but ye needn&rsquo;t be so highty-tighty,
Beck!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis truth as I be a-tellin&rsquo;
&rsquo;ee.&nbsp; Every one be a-talkin&rsquo; of it in
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, to be sure!&rdquo; ejaculated Rebecca, partially
convinced, but looking to her mistress for confirmation of the
strange statement.</p>
<p><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>&ldquo;It do seem queer,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Meatyard;
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s true, Becky; and as I was a-sayin&rsquo;, I
think you ought to try for it.&nbsp; You be turned seventy,
bain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I must be,&rdquo; said the old woman,
ruminating.&nbsp; &ldquo;My hair have been white this twenty year
and more, d&rsquo;ye see; and I haven&rsquo;t a tooth in my
head.&nbsp; I must be a tremenjious age, sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a bit hard to tell wi&rsquo; such as you,
Beck,&rdquo; remarked Farmer Meatyard, contemplating her
thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;You do seem to be sich a dried-up wold
stick&mdash;ah, and have been so ever since I knowed ye.&nbsp;
Ye&rsquo;ve never looked a bit different since ye come to this
&rsquo;ere village.&nbsp; How long ago was that, can you
mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, &rsquo;tis a bit hard to reckon,
Master&mdash;one year do seem so like another, and the days do
follow each other so fast.&nbsp; I lived down at Childe-Okeford
till I were thirty year of age, and then when mother died I went
to service, and I were ten year or thereabouts at a farm
Shillingstone way, and eight year at a public, and fifteen year
at another farm a mile out of Sturminster&mdash;I think
&rsquo;twas fifteen year, but it mid ha&rsquo; been
eighteen&mdash;and then I&rsquo;ve been here the rest of the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>&ldquo;An&rsquo; that must be twelve year or
more,&rdquo; put in her mistress, &ldquo;for I can call to mind
as Charl&rsquo; there was only just breeched when you did
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, woman, you must be comin&rsquo; on for
eighty,&rdquo; cried the farmer, half-admiringly,
half-disapprovingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bless me, ye haven&rsquo;t no
business to be alive at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He, he,&rdquo; chuckled Becky.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here I be,
ye see, sir; and if there&rsquo;s to be a prize for wold folks, I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if I did get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t call to mind anybody else in these parts
as can beat ye if your tale be true,&rdquo; returned he,
&ldquo;unless it&rsquo;s Mr. Sharp&rsquo;s Bithey.&nbsp; She be a
wonderful age, now&mdash;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if she&rsquo;s
turned her four score.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lard, no, sir!&rdquo; cried Rebecca, with a sudden
cessation of her laughter, while a flush began to mount in her
shrivelled cheeks.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bithey!&nbsp; Why, she&rsquo;s no
age at all to speak on.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ve ha&rsquo; got very
near all her teeth, and her hair&mdash;what there is of it, they
do say is as black as can be under that wold woolly net as she do
wear.&nbsp; She don&rsquo;t come up to my age, Master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She runs you very near though, Beck,&rdquo; cried
mischievous Charl&rsquo;, beginning to caper with glee.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s oncommon hard o&rsquo; hearin&rsquo;, <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>and she do
get the rheumatiz so bad in her j&rsquo;ints.&nbsp; Ther&rsquo;
be times, Mr. Sharp do say, as she can scarce walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh,&rdquo; cried Rebecca, with fine scorn,
&ldquo;what signifies that?&nbsp; A child mid get rheumatiz, and
I&rsquo;ve ha&rsquo; knowed folks so young as Missus be hard
o&rsquo; hearin&rsquo;.&nbsp; That don&rsquo;t prove
nothin&rsquo;.&nbsp; There, I must give over talkin&rsquo; here,
and get back to my work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She retired, muttering to herself and shaking her head, while
Charl&rsquo;, still chuckling, went off to fetch the cows.</p>
<p>He came back in a state of explosive excitement, and
immediately called his parents out of hearing of Rebecca, who had
stalked loftily past him, armed with stool and pail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never guess what I&rsquo;ve been
doin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he began.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jist as I was
crossin&rsquo; the lane down yonder, who should I see but wold
Bithey toddlin&rsquo; along in front of me; so I hollers after
her, and tells her all about the prize, and did advise her to go
in for it, and the wold body is that set up about it &rsquo;tis
as good as a play.&nbsp; She makes sure she is goin&rsquo; to win
it, and thinks nothin&rsquo; at all o&rsquo; poor Beck&rsquo;s
chance.&nbsp; Lard, &rsquo;twill be rare sport to set the two
wold folks one again t&rsquo;other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father laughed jovially, but the mother <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>inquired in
an aggrieved tone why he had interfered and lessened poor
Rebecca&rsquo;s chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, she&rsquo;ve a-been that excited all the
evenin&rsquo; thinkin&rsquo; about it&mdash;she&rsquo;ll be awful
disappointed if she don&rsquo;t get the prize.&nbsp; Besides, I
can&rsquo;t but think &rsquo;twould ha&rsquo; been a kind
o&rsquo; honour for we if she was to win it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she will, all the same,&rdquo; said
Charl&rsquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Bithey&rsquo;s
half so old myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he went away to do his share of the milking.</p>
<p>The news soon spread all over the village that both Rebecca
and Bithey intended to compete for the strange new-fangled prize
that was to be given at the forthcoming show.&nbsp; Opinions were
pretty evenly divided as to the respective merits of the two
aspirants, but much amusement was caused by the seriousness and
pertinacity with which each old lady advanced her claims.</p>
<p>On the Sunday following Charl&rsquo; mischievously brought the
rivals into contact by calling back Rebecca just as she had
haughtily walked past Bithey on leaving church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, Beck, for one minute.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s
Bithey won&rsquo;t believe you are any older nor her.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>Rebecca turned, eyeing Tabitha up and down somewhat
disdainfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye may believe it or not, as ye please,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;but you was a little maid goin&rsquo; to school when
I was out in service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does she say?&rdquo; inquired Tabitha, turning to
one of the bystanders&mdash;for quite a little crowd had gathered
around the two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says you are no age at all worth
countin&rsquo;,&rdquo; bawled Charl&rsquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
&rsquo;lows you be quite a little maid still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little maid, indeed!&rdquo; retorted Bithey.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know I must be seventy if I&rsquo;m a day, and I&rsquo;m
a&rsquo;most sure I&rsquo;m a good bit more nor that.&nbsp; Why,
I be getting that weak in the limbs I can scarce get
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody mid get weak in the limbs!&rdquo; cried Rebecca
wrathfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t no sign of age, that
isn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; When I did come to live at Thorncombe Farm,
twelve or fifteen years ago, I was a staid body, as anybody mid
see; but you&mdash;you was quite fresh and
well-lookin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I can mind it well.&nbsp; You did come
up to our place for a bit o&rsquo; lard soon arter I did get
there, and you was as straight and as active and as smooth and
chuffy in the face&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear! however can ye go for to tell sich tales,
Rebecca?&rdquo; groaned Bithey, much <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>scandalised.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can mind
that day so well as you, and I can mind as you did offer to carry
the lard for me as far as the gate, for, says you, &lsquo;You do
look mortal tired for sure,&rsquo; says you; &lsquo;and
&rsquo;tis a long way to carry it and you not bein&rsquo; so
young as you was&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, faith, Becky, the case is goin&rsquo; again&rsquo;
you!&rdquo; shouted Charl&rsquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;If ye said that,
it shows plain as you was treatin&rsquo; Bithey respectful like,
you bein&rsquo; the youngest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forgive you, Bithey!&rdquo; ejaculated the
dairywoman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you no conscience at all?&nbsp;
<i>I</i> say sich a thing!&nbsp; I offer to carry lard for
you!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas never my way to go in for payin&rsquo;
compliments to folks, and I&rsquo;d always plenty to do
wi&rsquo;out makin&rsquo; out more work for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; cried a fat, good-natured man who
had drawn near, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be fallin&rsquo; out on a
Sunday!&nbsp; There must be some way of knowin&rsquo; your
ages.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s see how far back you can remember, and
maybe that&rsquo;ll tell us summat.&nbsp; Can ye mind when
Rectory chimbley was blowed down?&nbsp; I were a little chap
myself then, but I can remember it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, that was afore my day,&rdquo; said Becky, much
crestfallen.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only been here a matter of
twelve or fifteen year.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>&ldquo;I can mind it,&rdquo; cried Bithey
eagerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can mind it so well as if it were
yesterday.&nbsp; I had my sampler in my hand, and when my mother
did call out I run the needle very nigh an inch into my
finger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you was a little gurl, for sure!&rdquo; exclaimed
Rebecca triumphantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye must ha&rsquo; been quite a
young maid, else ye wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; been workin&rsquo;
on a sampler.&nbsp; What year was that, Mr. Joyce?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; said Mr. Joyce
meditatively.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas in the year &rsquo;48, I
think&mdash;&rsquo;ees, I&rsquo;m very near sure &rsquo;twas
&rsquo;48.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; say you was ten year old then, Bithey,&rdquo;
went on the other claimant, with increasing animation, &ldquo;say
you was ten or twelve&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; been
much more, else you&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; had more sense nor to be
working samplers&mdash;well, &rsquo;tis but a little over fifty
year ago&mdash;that &rsquo;ud leave ye not much more nor
sixty.&nbsp; Ye haven&rsquo;t wore so very well, I d&rsquo;
&rsquo;low; but there, &rsquo;tis plain sixty&rsquo;s your
age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel sure I&rsquo;m a deal more nor sixty,&rdquo;
protested Bithey, almost in tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now I think
on&rsquo;t, &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t when Rectory chimbley was blowed
down as I did run needle into my finger; &rsquo;twas when Mr.
Sharp&rsquo;s roof took <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>fire.&nbsp; Can you mind when Mr.
Sharp&rsquo;s thatch took fire, Mr. Joyce?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, &rsquo;twas long afore my time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; <i>you</i> must be comin&rsquo; on about
sixty, Mr. Joyce?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I fancy that&rsquo;s about my age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tabitha cast a look of triumph towards Rebecca, who feigned
unconsciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can mind the time o&rsquo; the Crimee War,&rdquo; she
announced deliberately.</p>
<p>There was a chorus of derisive comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Crimean War!&nbsp; Why, that&rsquo;s scarce any
time ago,&rdquo; said Mr. Joyce.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas in the
fifties, I think; &rsquo;ees, I can remember the time very well
myself.&nbsp; That don&rsquo;t go for to prove nothin&rsquo;,
Rebecca.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s one comfort,&rdquo; returned she,
undaunted, &ldquo;us&rsquo;ll be judged by folks as don&rsquo;t
know us one from t&rsquo;other, and they&rsquo;ll be like to
judge us fair.&nbsp; There be things for and against both on
us.&nbsp; Bithey&rsquo;s hard o&rsquo; hearin&rsquo; and
wonderful stiff in her j&rsquo;ints, and all that&rsquo;ll be in
her favour; but if they do go for to judge us wold women same way
as they do judge harses, I reckon I&rsquo;ve a-got the best
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Charl&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if they go for to examine our teeth, to be sure;
they&rsquo;d see as I hadn&rsquo;t got none.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>And
further demonstrating the fact by a wide smile, Rebecca walked
away, followed by a burst of mirthful applause.</p>
<p>On the eventful morning of the Show all the inhabitants of
Thorncombe Farm assembled to see Rebecca start.&nbsp;
Charl&rsquo; was to drive her to the town, for, as he explained,
it would never do for her to let on she was hearty enough to walk
such a distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was you, Beck,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
make out to have a bit of a limp.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould go far to
make ye evener like wi&rsquo; Bithey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; returned Rebecca stoutly, &ldquo;I was
never one for makin&rsquo; out what wasn&rsquo;t true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smooth down your hair a bit under your bonnet,&rdquo;
advised Mrs. Meatyard anxiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;It mid be any
colour tucked away like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As this injunction could be obeyed without detriment to her
principles, the old woman pushed back her bonnet and pulled into
greater prominence her scanty snowy side-locks.&nbsp; Then she
climbed into the cart, with a palpitating heart, and sat
clutching at her umbrella while they jogged out of the yard, and
down the green lane, and out on the dusty high road.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Meatyard did not make their appearance at the
Show till the afternoon, when most of the judging was over, and
only <a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>that important part of the programme which related to
various feats of horsemanship remained to be carried out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hunt up Becky afore we go to look at the
jumpin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the farmer to his wife, as they passed
through the turnstile and threaded their way amid the various
stalls and pens containing exhibits from all parts of the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Here a beautiful little red Devon cow thrust
a moist protesting nose through the railings; there a sturdy
black-faced ram made abortive butts with his curled horns at the
passers-by; yonder a pen of cackling geese flapped distracted
wings and extended yards of snowy neck with prodigious outcry;
and now there was a stampede among the ever-increasing crowd, as
a great cart-colt was led past floundering and kicking.</p>
<p>The Meatyards stared about them, and wondered and commented,
and had almost forgotten Becky in their interest and excitement,
when they suddenly came upon her, walking arm-in-arm with no
other person than her rival Bithey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why bless me, Rebecca, so here ye be!&rdquo; cried the
farmer.&nbsp; &ldquo;And Bithey, too.&nbsp; What!&nbsp;
Han&rsquo;t ye been judged yet?&nbsp; An&rsquo; who&rsquo;s the
winner?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>&ldquo;What does he say?&rdquo; asked Tabitha
plaintively of the other competitor, and the Meatyards noticed
with surprise that her tone was meek, and indeed confiding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master do want to know if we&rsquo;ve a&rsquo; been
judged yet, my dear,&rdquo; returned Becky soothingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I reckon he&rsquo;ll be surprised when he do hear how
we&rsquo;ve a-been used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ees indeed,&rdquo; sighed Bithey, and she wiped
her eyes with a corner of her shawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, don&rsquo;t take &rsquo;ee on, my dear,&rdquo;
said Rebecca, patting her hand affectionately.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
poor soul,&rdquo; she explained, turning to the farmer and his
wife, who were gazing at the pair open-mouthed, &ldquo;the poor
soul do seem to be quite undone.&nbsp; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low
&rsquo;twas a shame to go and disapp&rsquo;int her so.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twill ha&rsquo; gied her quite a turn&mdash;at her age
an&rsquo; all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis no worse for me nor &rsquo;tis for you, my
dear,&rdquo; put in Bithey with a groan of sympathy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You had farther to come nor me, an&rsquo; you must be half
shook to pieces a-ridin&rsquo; in that wold cart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name o&rsquo; fortun&rsquo;,&rdquo; cried the
exasperated Mr. Meatyard, &ldquo;which on you did get the
prize?&nbsp; There you do go chatterin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
jabberin&rsquo; and neither of you will tell us which be the
winner.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d never think&mdash;&rdquo; began
Bithey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the most unfairest thing you ever did hear
on!&rdquo; exclaimed Becky.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was the two of
us&mdash;the woldest women for miles round, I&rsquo;ll go
bail.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure ye did only need to look at Bithey
here to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; wailed Tabitha, &ldquo;the
very sight o&rsquo; your grey hair did ought to ha&rsquo; shamed
them, Becky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the impatient farmer made a sudden lunge at them, almost
after the fashion of the curly-horned prize ram, and the two old
women simultaneously announced in an agitated whimper:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, they didn&rsquo;t give the prize to neither of
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear heart alive! you don&rsquo;t say so?&rdquo; said
Mrs. Meatyard, after a pause of blank amazement, while her
husband uttered a shrill whistle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
&rsquo;ee get no prize at all then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee so much as &lsquo;&rsquo;Ighly
Commended,&rsquo; Beck?&rdquo; cried her master, recovering from
his stupor, and uttering a roar of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; returned Rebecca mournfully, &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t get nothin&rsquo; at all&mdash;nor Bithey
neither.&nbsp; They never took a bit of notice after they&rsquo;d
axed how long we&rsquo;d been in our present <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>sitooations.&nbsp; They went and give the butter-dish
to quite a young &rsquo;ooman.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think she can
ha&rsquo; been more nor fifty-five.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ees, sir, if
ye&rsquo;ll believe me, a big strapping woman as stout as me and
Bithey put together, and so firm on her legs as
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; whistled the farmer again, &ldquo;you
don&rsquo;t say so!&nbsp; Well, I never did&mdash;there must
ha&rsquo; been some reason as you didn&rsquo;t know
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she was blind,&rdquo; suggested Mrs.
Meatyard.&nbsp; &ldquo;That &rsquo;ud be a p&rsquo;int in her
favour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more blind nor yourself, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
returned Becky almost triumphantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;d
a-been thirty year in the one place&mdash;that was all as I could
hear as she could say for herself, and they went and give her the
butter-dish wi&rsquo;out no more talk than that.&nbsp; So, when I
did see how upset poor Bithey was&mdash;an&rsquo; she so troubled
with the rheumatiz, poor wold body&mdash;I jist says to her, says
I, &lsquo;You take my arm, my dear,&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;you
jist come along of I.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she were glad enough to do
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low I was,&rdquo; agreed her whilom
rival.&nbsp; &ldquo;I reckon I thought it oncommon kind.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Ees,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;Becky love,&rsquo; says I,
&lsquo;I take it oncommon kind o&rsquo; you to help me same <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>as
you&rsquo;re a-doin&rsquo; of, for ye bain&rsquo;t so young
yourself,&rsquo; says I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Meatyard slapped his thigh and shouted with laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve changed your note, I see&mdash;both on
you,&rdquo; he exclaimed as soon as he could speak.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, and where are you bound for now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, d&rsquo;ye see, sir,&rdquo; said Becky, &ldquo;her
an&rsquo; me is both tired o&rsquo; this&mdash;we are&mdash;jist
about!&nbsp; And so she says to me, says she, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s
go over to one o&rsquo; them little booths over there and set
down for a bit, and rest us.&rsquo;&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t ye,
Bithey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Bithey, &ldquo;and I says,
&lsquo;Becky,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;arter all this
standin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; all this talkin&rsquo;, and all the
dust and sawdust flyin&rsquo; about, I&rsquo;m awful dry,&rsquo;
I says; &lsquo;what would you say,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;to a
bottle of Pop?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmer laughed again, but his wife strongly advised the
old couple to have recourse to that restorative, and they
therefore toddled away together to drown the memory of their
differences and, if possible, of their disappointment in a
sparkling and innocuous glass.</p>
<h2><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>THE
LOVER&rsquo;S WRAITH.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Well</span>, I don&rsquo;t believe
in no such nonsense.&nbsp; Folks do get a-talkin&rsquo; and
a-carryin&rsquo; tales fro&rsquo; one to the other, but I never
met anybody yet as see a ghost, and I don&rsquo;t believe nobody
ever did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are wrong for once then,&rdquo; cried Martha; and
she pulled away her arm, the elbow of which had till then been
linked in Sam Bundy&rsquo;s&mdash;for the two were
&ldquo;walking&rdquo; in orthodox fashion&mdash;and turned round
to face him, an angry flush mounting in her cheeks.</p>
<p>Martha Dale was a very pretty girl, and never more so than in
her working dress, which, being of pink cotton, intensified the
glow on her cheeks and threw into yet stronger relief the
darkness of eyes and hair.&nbsp; A little fitful evening breeze
was now playing with the dusky tendrils about her brow, setting
one tiny curl dancing, indeed, after a fashion which Sam would
have found tantalising at any other time; but now he was too much
in earnest.</p>
<p><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>&ldquo;It do seem sich a pity for a sensible maid same
as you to be took in by sich rubbish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank &rsquo;ee,&rdquo; rejoined Martha.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
s&rsquo;pose my own grandma is a liar then, for &rsquo;twas she
as told me the tale, and she did say as she saw it wi&rsquo; her
own eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, a ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it couldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; been a ghost for
&rsquo;twas the sperret of a man as was alive.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas
the custom, she says, for all the young folks to wait outside
church-porch at midnight on Midsummer Eve, and if they was to get
married during the year they&rsquo;d see the sperrets of them
they was to get married with go into the church and come out
again.&nbsp; And they&rsquo;d see the sperret, or the shape, or
whatever ye mid call it, of them as was to die during the year
too&mdash;only that kind didn&rsquo;t never come out o&rsquo; the
church again; they did jist walk in wi&rsquo; grave sorrowful
faces, and did seem to bide there.&nbsp; But my grandma she
telled me often how plain she saw granfer a-comin&rsquo; out of
church&mdash;there, he did pass so close to her she could very
nigh ha&rsquo; touched him, only she was afeared.&nbsp; And sure
enough he axed her two months arter to the very day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam walked along in silence, chewing a blade of grass which he
had plucked from <a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>beneath the hedge; his broad chip hat was set somewhat
at the back of his head, and his open sunburnt face, thus fully
exposed to view, wore an expression of incredulity and
dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye don&rsquo;t believe me, I see,&rdquo; said Martha
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t say that.&nbsp; I b&rsquo;lieve ye
think you are speakin&rsquo; the truth&mdash;&rsquo;tis as true
as you heared it&mdash;&rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t as if you was
tryin&rsquo; to make me believe as you&rsquo;d seen the thing
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Martha, with a flash in her
black eyes, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be tellin&rsquo; you that, come
next Midsummer Eve.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go myself, and stand in
church-porch, and maybe I&rsquo;ll see Bob Ellery a-comin&rsquo;
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob Ellery!&rdquo; ejaculated Sam, stopping short
again, and throwing away his blade of grass.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it
<i>him</i> ye&rsquo;re thinkin&rsquo; of lookin&rsquo;
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Martha, slightly raising her
voice; &ldquo;as well him as another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sam, striking the nailed heel of his
heavy boot into the ground, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s just the one to be
up to sich foolishness&mdash;the biggest sammy between this and
Dorchester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be makin&rsquo; free wi&rsquo; your
own name,&rdquo; retorted the girl sarcastically.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
<a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>know one
sammy as ain&rsquo;t so far off.&nbsp; But ye needn&rsquo;t be
turnin&rsquo; up your nose at Bob Ellery, Mr. Sam Bundy&mdash;him
and me&rsquo;s very thick, and I don&rsquo;t like to hear my
friends abused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look ye here, Martha,&rdquo; said Sam, controlling
his rising anger.&nbsp; &ldquo;This here be real foolish talk
between you and I, as has been a-walkin&rsquo; ever since
Christmas.&nbsp; If you was to look for anybody a-comin&rsquo;
out o&rsquo; church, it should be me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you are much too grand to think o&rsquo;
lettin&rsquo; your sperret do any sich thing.&nbsp; Bob
bain&rsquo;t so stuck up&mdash;he don&rsquo;t set up for being no
wiser than the rest of us.&nbsp; But as for you&mdash;if we was
to spill the salt between us I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d
ever think o&rsquo; throwin&rsquo; a pinch over your
shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose I should,&rdquo; he replied,
bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You was brought up wi&rsquo; such notions!&rdquo; she
continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your mother didn&rsquo;t ever set ye on a
donkey&rsquo;s back wi&rsquo; your face to the tail, did
she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t call to mind as she did,&rdquo; returned
he, staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t her fault, nor yours neither,
it ye didn&rsquo;t die o&rsquo; the whooping cough,&rdquo; cried
Martha triumphantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas the first thing <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>as ever my
mother did do wi&rsquo; the lot of us, except my little brother
Walter, and he was the only one as ever took that complaint, and
never looked up after&mdash;just withered away, one mid say, and
died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he didn&rsquo;t sit with his face to the
ass&rsquo;s tail,&rdquo; said Sam, relaxing into a broad
grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye did ought to be ashamed o&rsquo; yourself, Sam, to
go a-sneerin&rsquo; like that&mdash;there be a cross on the
donkey&rsquo;s back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam thrust his hands deep into the pockets of his corduroys,
and paced beside her without speaking for a moment or two; then
he turned to her with a good-humoured laugh:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe what you like, my maid, only don&rsquo;t ask me
to say I do do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not axin&rsquo; you nothin&rsquo; at all,
I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; returned Martha indifferently, though
again the tell-tale colour swept over cheek and brow.&nbsp; She
stooped presently, and plucked an ox-eye daisy from beneath the
hedge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This year; next year; some time; never!&nbsp; This
year&mdash;next year&mdash;some time&mdash;never&mdash;This
year&mdash;next year&mdash;some time&mdash;never!&nbsp;
<i>This</i> year!&mdash;I wonder if &rsquo;tis to be wi&rsquo;
Bob Ellery.&nbsp; Come, I&rsquo;ll try his fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She possessed herself of another daisy, and <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>was about
to resume her performance when Sam, laying his hand on hers,
firmly imprisoned both the busy fingers and the blossom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martha,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there be some things a
man can stand, and there be some things he can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Now
I can&rsquo;t stand hearing you carry on this &rsquo;ere kind
o&rsquo; nonsense about Bob Ellery.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s got to be
one way or t&rsquo;other&mdash;him or me.&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s me
jist gi&rsquo;e me your word as ye&rsquo;ll drop this &rsquo;ere
talk o&rsquo; tryin&rsquo; your fortun&rsquo; wi&rsquo;
him.&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s him in earnest&mdash;I&rsquo;ll bid you
good evenin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martha was proud as well as pretty, and resented the
peremptory tone; she jerked away her hands, and tossed her
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps I won&rsquo;t wait for you to say
it, Mr. Bundy&mdash;p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps I can say &lsquo;Good
evenin&rsquo;&rsquo; jist so plain as ye can yourself.&nbsp;
<i>Good evenin&rsquo;</i>, Mr. Samuel Bundy.&nbsp; I wish ye a
pleasant walk home, and hope ye may soon find a sweetheart clever
enough to suit ye.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;d best ax
schoolmissus&mdash;she bain&rsquo;t much more nor fifty-four, and
I reckon she&rsquo;s not one to go a-waitin&rsquo; in
church-porch to look for sperrets&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell ye later
on who <i>I</i> see on Midsummer Eve;
but&mdash;I&mdash;think&mdash;I&mdash;know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had been dropping little ironical curtsies to him
throughout this speech, and now walked <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>away,
plucking the leaves from her crushed daisy, and singing
&ldquo;I&mdash;think&mdash;I&mdash;know&rdquo; until she had
turned the corner of the lane.</p>
<p>Sam stood looking after her until she was out of sight, and
then, drawing a deep breath, began to move slowly homewards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that is the end!&rdquo; he said to himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And I thought she was terrible fond of me.&nbsp; These
maids&mdash;there bain&rsquo;t no knowin&rsquo; where to have
&rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>On the following Sunday the once tender lovers walked apart,
and Sam invented no more pretexts for passing Martha&rsquo;s home
of a weekday evening as he had been wont to do, just for a
glimpse of her in the doorway or at the window, or, as had not
infrequently happened, standing accidentally by the gate.&nbsp;
On these occasions he had been used to invite her to walk with
him &ldquo;just so far as the top of the lane;&rdquo; it was,
indeed, during the course of one of these little strolls that the
quarrel had taken place.&nbsp; But now, though oddly enough just
about that time of evening Martha was to be seen pretty often
looking out of the window, or leaning against the doorpost, or
even gazing absently up and down the lane from the garden gate,
Sam Bundy passed that way no more.</p>
<p><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>When
Sunday came again Bob Ellery chanced to overtake Martha as she
was returning home from church, a fact which Sam Bundy, who had
passed the girl a moment before with an immovable face, carefully
noted; and when Bob, with an agreeable smile, inquired if Martha
was likely to be walking out that afternoon, he was answered with
such flattering civility that he took courage to propose to be
her companion.</p>
<p>But Martha&rsquo;s family noticed that she came in from the
expedition in a very bad humour.&nbsp; Bob was a thick-headed
young man, and he had not much to say for himself; and he had
brought his pipe with him and puffed the smoke in Martha&rsquo;s
face and laughed at her for minding it; and, moreover, he had
wanted to kiss her on parting, which she had thought very
presumptuous on so short an acquaintance&mdash;Sam had walked
with her for at least three Sundays before he had made any such
attempt&mdash;altogether she was ruffled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon ye did like Sam best,&rdquo; remarked her
sister, as Martha tossed her hat on to the bed.</p>
<p>The other started and answered angrily: &ldquo;I may have
liked him to begin wi&rsquo;, but I fair hate him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>&ldquo;Well, Bob Ellery bain&rsquo;t so bad,&rdquo;
returned the sister soothingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;His nose do seem to
turn up a good bit, and he&rsquo;ve got an awful big head, but
I&rsquo;ve seen many as was worse looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s other chaps besides Sam and Bob,&rdquo;
retorted Martha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; enquired the other eagerly, thinking her
sister had made a new conquest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;there&rsquo;s lots of
&rsquo;em about.&nbsp; Do ye mind Granny&rsquo;s silly old tale
about goin&rsquo; to the church-porch on Midsummer
Eve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do.&nbsp; Are ye thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo;
tryin&rsquo; it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martha nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to find out summat for certain,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lard, I should be frightened to death to try it.&nbsp;
Ugh!&nbsp; Fancy standin&rsquo; there among the graves all alone
in the dark a-waitin&rsquo; for a sperret!&nbsp; Maybe ye
mightn&rsquo;t like him when he did come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I be a-thinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
said Martha, with a sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d like to find
out&mdash;it &rsquo;ud be a kind o&rsquo; satisfaction to know
for sure, and not to keep on wonderin&rsquo; if it&rsquo;s to be
this one or that one.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t do it if I was
you,&rdquo; said the sister.</p>
<p>But Martha was obdurate.</p>
<p>Shortly after the clock struck eleven on the fateful night she
crept softly out of the house, and sped noiselessly through the
village, and up the lane until she came to the church.</p>
<p>It was a warm, still night, with a large, sultry moon swimming
overhead, and outlining with silver the grey walls of the sacred
building and the many tombstones which studded the green
enclosure round it.</p>
<p>Martha stood still, catching her breath, then tremulously
unlatched the gate and went up the flagged path.&nbsp; She paused
midway, raising her hand to her head:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Grandma say &lsquo;<i>In</i> church-porch&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Nigh to church-porch&rsquo;?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t mind
which.&nbsp; The porch do seem to be awful dark&mdash;and
&rsquo;twould be oncommon close inside.&nbsp; There do seem to be
scarce room for the sperrets to get past if you was to stand
there, without they went through you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shivered: the porch did certainly look uninviting, swathed
as it was in awful shadow, and festooned with ivy, tendrils of
which stirred every now and then, uncannily as it seemed, for
there was no breeze, and the <a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>motion was probably caused by some
of the many birds that had made homes for themselves in its green
fastnesses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon it will do just as well if I stop here under
tree,&rdquo; said Martha decisively.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can see
everything what goes in or out, and &rsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t be so
far to run if&mdash;&rdquo; she glanced apprehensively at the
porch again, measured the distance between it and the gate, and
finally, moving swiftly towards the latter, propped it carefully
open with a large stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The road do run all downhill too,&rdquo; she said to
herself, feeling somewhat reassured as she glanced down the lane;
she possessed a light pair of heels&mdash;even if a spirit were
to pursue her she fancied she could distance it.</p>
<p>Under the big cypress tree she now took up her stand, drawing
her dark skirts closely about her, and only peering out
occasionally behind the trunk.&nbsp; The moments passed very
slowly, as it seemed to her; now and then the squeak of a bat
broke the stillness, at other times a rustle in the long grass
betokened the passage of some nocturnal wanderer&mdash;a stoat
possibly, or a rat.&nbsp; On these occasions Martha would hitch
up her skirts a little and look fearfully round&mdash;she was
almost as much afraid of rats as of ghosts.&nbsp; Once she
thought <a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>she heard a kind of stealthy movement in the grass just
behind her, and almost uttered a shriek of terror as the
possibility occurred to her that it might be a snake.&nbsp; After
looking over her shoulder in the endeavour to ascertain the cause
of this mysterious sound she turned round again suddenly.</p>
<p>Lo! advancing with swift and noiseless tread up the flagged
path was a figure, the outlines of which were strangely familiar
to her.&nbsp; As it approached nearer to her place of ambush the
moonlight distinctly revealed a countenance which seemed to be
that of Samuel Bundy.&nbsp; <i>Seemed</i> to be I say, for it
wore an expression strangely unlike that which Martha had been
accustomed to see on the blunt and honest face of her former
lover: an expression of stern gravity; the eyes were fixed, the
mouth resolutely set, the face, moreover, was deadly pale in the
moonlight, and what alarmed Martha more than anything else was
the fact that the figure moved onward without making a
sound.&nbsp; Into the church-porch it passed, and was there
engulfed by the darkness.</p>
<p>Martha&rsquo;s heart was thumping like a sledgehammer; it was
Sam sure enough&mdash;or rather Sam&rsquo;s wraith, for surely no
living thing could look or move in that ghostly fashion.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s to be him after all!&rdquo; gasped
Martha, with an odd little choked spasm of laughter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dear, to be sure!&nbsp; I wonder if he d&rsquo; know as
his sperret have a-come here to-night.&nbsp; He must be
dreamin&rsquo; o&rsquo; me&mdash;I reckon he&rsquo;ll have to
believe now when I d&rsquo; tell him. . . .&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;d
liefer &rsquo;twas him nor Bob, anyhow.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll own he
be wrong arter this, an&rsquo; then all &rsquo;ull be pleasant
again between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaned her head against the spice-scented cypress bark,
and smiled to herself, though she still trembled, partly with
awe, partly with pleasurable anticipation.&nbsp; When the church
clock chimed midnight, then might she confidently expect the
wraith of her future husband to come gliding forth from the
church into which it had so silently passed, and might gaze with
certainty on the likeness of the man decreed to be the partner of
her lot.&nbsp; It was a solemn thought, but a joyful one; any
contact with the supernatural must be awe-inspiring, but Martha
was a bold girl, and eminently practical, and she passed the
moments which must intervene before the reappearance of the
vision in choosing the colour of her wedding gown.</p>
<p>Clang! boomed out the clock in the church tower presently, and
as the reverberating <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>strokes fell upon the air, Martha,
philosophical though she was, was conscious of a recurrence of
the choking sensation of a little while before.&nbsp; The last
vibrating echo died away, and she craned forward her head,
fearful and yet eager.&nbsp; All was silent as the graves in the
midst of which she stood; she strained her eyes towards the
porch, but no white impalpable shape came forth from its
blackness.</p>
<p>All at once Martha&rsquo;s heart ceased its violent beating,
and appeared to stand still: a new and awful thought had come to
her.&nbsp; Had not her grandmother told her the dread fate which
awaited the originals of those whose semblance passed into the
church without again reappearing?&nbsp; Her own words to Sam
recurred to her: &ldquo;Them as is to die within the year do seem
to go into the church and <i>don&rsquo;t never come out
again</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Could it be possible that the apparition
which had filled her with so much satisfaction a few moments
before was the portent of poor Sam&rsquo;s early death?</p>
<p>Unnerved by this terrible idea she rent the stillness with a
series of muffled shrieks and sobs:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sam, Sam!&nbsp; Oh, dear Sam!&nbsp; Oh, Sam, come
out, come out!&nbsp; Whatever shall I do?&nbsp; Sam, come
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>Her
tears were flowing so fast that she was obliged to have recourse
to her apron, and, enveloped in its folds and overcome by
increasing grief, failed to hear the series of heavy thuds which
denoted the rapid approach of the figure which had suddenly
emerged from the church-porch.</p>
<p>Could any spirit be endowed with such a pair of sturdy arms as
those which were now thrown about her, or be capable of bestowing
such resounding and fervent salutes as those which were presently
rained on brow and cheeks?&nbsp; Martha uttered one
blood-curdling yell, and then stood still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my pretty,&rdquo; cried Sam&rsquo;s voice, which
sounded very real and comfortable, &ldquo;what be all this
shindy?&nbsp; Have anybody been a-frightenin&rsquo; of ye?&nbsp;
Have that rascal Bob been up to any games?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still clutching her in a tight embrace, he looked fiercely
round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob!&rdquo; ejaculated Martha.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bob!&nbsp;
Why what should he&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She broke off suddenly,
adding with a wail of recurrent anguish: &ldquo;Oh, Sam&mdash;oh,
Sam, ye don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve a-seen this night!&nbsp;
There, my heart be fair broke.&nbsp; I can never tell &rsquo;ee,
but if ye knowed!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>&ldquo;Nonsense, my maid,&rdquo; cried Sam with a
reassuring squeeze.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye haven&rsquo;t seen nothing at
all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been a-sittin&rsquo; in church-porch all
the time an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; have come nigh the
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; gasped Martha, &ldquo;&rsquo;twas
yourself&mdash;your own self as comed here&mdash;I&mdash;did
think &rsquo;twas your sperret.&nbsp; Why whatever made ye walk
so queer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a chuckle Sam uplifted a large broad foot protected only
by a stocking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought, ye see,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;as that
there silly Bob &rsquo;ud very like be up to some
tricks&mdash;makin&rsquo; believe to appear to ye, or some such
thing&mdash;so, thinks I to myself, I&rsquo;ll just bide handy in
porch and if he do try it on I&rsquo;ll pounce out on
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Martha, &ldquo;why I don&rsquo;t
suppose he knows naught about nothing of the kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye didn&rsquo;t tell him your grandma&rsquo;s tale,
then?&rdquo; said Sam, with a note of incredulous delight in his
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no,&rdquo; said Martha&mdash;&ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t reckon &rsquo;twould interes&rsquo; him, d&rsquo;ye
see.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas different wi&rsquo; you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Sam laughed long and loud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martha,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I take back all
as I said agen this here old custom&mdash;I can <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>see as
there be sense in it.&nbsp; Ah, a deal o&rsquo; sense in
it.&nbsp; My sperret, d&rsquo;ye see, was very anxious to come to
&rsquo;ee, Martha&mdash;that anxious that it did take the rest
o&rsquo; me along wi&rsquo; it.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if
the rest of the tale was to come true too&mdash;about
gettin&rsquo; married soon arter, ye know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps I&rsquo;ll have summat to say about
that,&rdquo; tittered Martha coyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye can&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo; but the one
thing,&rdquo; returned Sam triumphantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t be lucky!&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;You do seem to be choppin&rsquo; a lot this evenin&rsquo;,
Dada&rdquo;</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>He
had not long been promoted to the dignity of knickerbockers, and
was the proud possessor of pockets which still retained all the
charm of novelty.&nbsp; Into one of these pockets he now dived
from time to time, extracting from its depths (which were not
very profound) a small round wooden box, the lid of which he
proceeded to unscrew; a painful squeaking accompanying the
process.&nbsp; This, on being removed, displayed a bright,
threepenny-bit; and Johnny, taking it out, contemplated it for a
moment in the broad palm of his grimy little hand, turned it
over, polished it on the knee of his little breeches, replaced it
in its receptacle, screwed on the lid again with laborious
grinding, and finally restored the whole to his pocket.</p>
<p>Observing, after these operations had been gone through some
half-dozen times, that his father allowed them to pass unnoticed,
Johnny heaved a deep sigh and made a remark on his own
account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do seem to be choppin&rsquo; a lot this
evenin&rsquo;, Dada.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ees, Johnny, I be&rdquo;&mdash;and here John
Reed senior laid down his hatchet, straightened himself, and
wiped his brow.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have to chop so much as your
mother will want <a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>to-morrow and next day too, d&rsquo; ye see?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to Shroton to-morrow wi&rsquo; Maggie and
Rosie.&nbsp; If you be a good little chap I&rsquo;ll bring
&rsquo;ee a cake, maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny uncrossed his legs and sat rigid on the block, his eyes
apparently ready to jump out of his head.&nbsp; The father nodded
good-naturedly, and took up his axe again.&nbsp; The son threw
out his hand after the manner employed by scholars desirous of
attracting the teacher&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bide a bit!&rdquo;&mdash;with a quaint assumption of
authority&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got summat to show &rsquo;ee
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chubby hand sought the pocket once more, the box was
produced, and its contents displayed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
fruppence,&rdquo; announced Johnny triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have &rsquo;ee, now?&rdquo; returned Reed kindly but
dispassionately.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well done!&nbsp; Where did
&rsquo;ee get that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gran&rsquo;ma gived it me.&nbsp;
Dada!&rdquo;&mdash;here Johnny got off the
block&mdash;&ldquo;Dada, do &rsquo;ee take me to the fair
to-morrow, and let me &rsquo;pend it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I never!&rdquo; cried the father, half puzzled and
half admiring.&nbsp; &ldquo;You be too little,
Johnny&mdash;you&rsquo;d be tired out afore the day was half
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>&ldquo;Nay, nay&rdquo; and the little head was shaken
until the golden mop was in full display.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay,
I&rsquo;d not be tired.&nbsp; I can walk so far as Rosie,
an&rsquo; I do want to go in the roundabouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to go in the roundabouts, do &rsquo;ee?&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s a tale.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here John Reed laughed,
scratched his head, and contemplated his small sturdy son.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low you&rsquo;d enjoy the roundabouts,
and the shows and that&mdash;jist about.&nbsp; But we
shan&rsquo;t be home till late.&nbsp; And whatever &rsquo;ud
Mother say?&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;d best stop an&rsquo; take care of
Mother, I reckon, Sonny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Johnny junior.&nbsp; &ldquo;I be
goin&rsquo; with &rsquo;ee; Mammy have got Puss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thereupon the red-haired giant laughed long and loud, and
the imp beside him knew the victory was his.</p>
<p>The sun was sinking when they came indoors, both looking
extremely important, albeit somewhat sheepish, as became a pair
of conspirators.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed stood by the window mending the coat which her
master was to wear on the morrow; Maggie, a tall, shapely girl of
seventeen, was ironing a starched white petticoat; while Rosie,
the younger daughter, busily stitched a lace frill on the neck of
<a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>her
Sunday dress.&nbsp; An air of joyful bustle and excitement
pervaded the place, for, although Mrs. Reed herself had ceased to
join in the annual outing, she was good-natured enough to share
the others&rsquo; pleasure at the prospect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, Missus, I&rsquo;ve cut ye enough wood to do ye
for a week,&rdquo; announced John, &ldquo;an&rsquo; me and the
little chap &rsquo;ull feed chicken jist now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for Johnny to go to bed,&rdquo;
remarked the mother, gazing at him fondly, however.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s best out of the way to-night&mdash;there do
always seem to be sich a lot to be done afore Shroton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; agreed John falteringly,
&ldquo;p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps he would be best abed, more particular
as he has a mind to come wi&rsquo; us to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a chorus of surprise and disapproval, in the midst
of which Johnny stood silent, gazing from one to the other with a
solemn, resolute little face.&nbsp; It was not until
&ldquo;Dada&rdquo; himself had begun to show signs of wavering
that the little fellow suddenly sat down on the ground and began
to cry.</p>
<p>Now Johnny occupied a somewhat unique position in the family,
which may thus be accounted for: Rosie and Maggie had come <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>tumbling
into the world hard on each other&rsquo;s heels; and then five
little graves, side by side under the churchyard yew, marked the
advent and departure of five little boys, not one of whom had
lived more than a few years; and then, after a long interval,
when the cradle had been put away and the baby-clothes laid by on
the top shelf of the cupboard, Johnny had made his appearance;
and Johnny had from the first evinced a determination to live,
and from the moment he could walk had become the recognised ruler
of the entire household.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Johnny lifted up his voice in protest, general
consternation ensued.&nbsp; Dada, taking him in his arms,
upbraided the women-folk, and remarked indignantly that the child
was not so big yet but what he could carry him if he was tired:
and Maggie with a blush reminded her mother that Jim Fry was
going to give them a lift to Shroton and back, and therefore
there would be no need for Johnny to walk except just at the Fair
itself; and Rosie observed that he didn&rsquo;t seem to be one
for catching cold, and, moreover, opined that he would look
beautiful in his new suit, and that it did seem a pity that he
couldn&rsquo;t wear it where it could be seen.&nbsp; This last
suggestion turned the scale, and <a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>Johnny dried his eyes and was
carried off to bed in triumph.</p>
<p>On the next morning the entire household was enlisted in the
service of the youngest-born.&nbsp; The father, coming upon Rosie
as she was blacking his sturdy little Sunday boots, desired her
to hand them over&mdash;he&rsquo;d show her how to make &rsquo;em
shine.&nbsp; And shine they certainly did when he had done with
them, for, though he could with difficulty squeeze two of his
great fingers into them, he polished them with as much energy as
would have sufficed for full-sized Wellingtons.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Maggie was sedulously brushing the smart new
sailor-suit, and the little pilot-coat with its two rows of brass
buttons, while Mrs. Reed was carefully winding round her fingers
the yellow curls which looked so much better when allowed to
cluster freely about brow and neck, but which were now persuaded
to assume the corkscrew shape dear to the village mother&rsquo;s
heart.&nbsp; She devoted particular time and care to the
arrangement of a top-knot, which much resembled a small
sausage-roll, and was poised immediately above Johnny&rsquo;s
right eye.&nbsp; At last the only son of the house stood arrayed
in all his glory, while the admiring family gathered round.</p>
<p><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>&ldquo;He do look a pictur&rsquo;&mdash;I&rsquo;ll say
that for him,&rdquo; remarked the father proudly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll not be his like at the Fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See and keep your coat buttoned, Johnny,&rdquo;
observed Mrs. Reed anxiously; &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee go
for to take off your muffler, not if you be ever so
warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny rolled his eyes towards his mother over the white
woollen folds&mdash;which, indeed, very nearly came up to
them&mdash;and then looked down to where the fringed ends showed
beneath the bottom of his coat.&nbsp; The comforter was certainly
uncomfortably warm, and the day was mild and sunny; but Johnny
was in the mood to promise anything; therefore he gravely
nodded.</p>
<p>Presently the sound of wheels was heard, and Jim Fry&rsquo;s
&ldquo;trap&rdquo; halted outside the little garden-gate.&nbsp;
Jim himself looked very smart in his best clothes; his hat being
set on at a knowing angle over his well-sleeked locks; a nosegay
about the size of a saucer in his button-hole.&nbsp; There were
flowers, too, at the horse&rsquo;s ears, and the harness was
polished to a nicety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, how had we best divide?&rdquo; inquired
Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;Suppose you sit next me, Maggie, and Rosie
t&rsquo; other side of you?&nbsp; And <a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>if you&rsquo;ll get up behind
wi&rsquo; the little chap, Mr. Reed, you&rsquo;ll just about
balance us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Reed stared a little, winked solemnly at his wife, and
finally agreed; and the girls came tripping down the path, Maggie
blushing as she clambered into the cart, while Rosie, with many
giggles, ascended on the other side.&nbsp; Then little John waved
his hand from his place beside his father, big John shouted
&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; in a stentorian voice, Jim Fry cracked the
whip, and they were off.</p>
<p>Oh, what a merry drive was that!&nbsp; The old horse hammering
along briskly, up the hills as well as down, and covering the
ground at a prodigious rate, constantly overtaking other parties
of pleasure-seekers who were proceeding more soberly, some on
waggons, some on foot, some in little donkey carts.&nbsp; Now the
pretty village of Stourpaine was left behind; a few old folks
came to their doors to look after the dashing equipage, and some
children ran for a little way beside the horse; now they turned
off by Steepleton, and for a while enjoyed the shade of the
plantation farther on; and at last they drew near the scene of
the Fair itself, being forced to proceed more slowly, for the
road was well-nigh blocked with vehicles.</p>
<p><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>A
mingled and extraordinary din greeted their ears as they
approached.&nbsp; The shrieking music of the merry-go-rounds
mingling with the shouting and laughter of many voices, the
banging of the shooting-galleries, the hoarse cries intermingled
with trumpet-blasts from proprietors of the different shows.</p>
<p>Johnny was at first disposed to be alarmed, and clutched his
father&rsquo;s hand somewhat tightly, but when the latter
cheerily remarked that it was &ldquo;rare sport&rdquo; the little
fellow strove to put away his fears, and to think it rare sport
too.</p>
<p>Presently he was securely mounted on John Reed&rsquo;s great
shoulders, and watched the jumping of the horses, which were sent
from all parts of the country for sale.&nbsp; It was exciting to
see the dealers flap their crackling calico flags, and with
strange, uncouth cries urge on the animal actually under
inspection to show off his paces, and to leap an adjoining
hedge&mdash;the latter feat being one not often accomplished; the
rider indeed, much to the delight of the lookers-on, more
frequently taking the fence than the horse.&nbsp; It was,
however, a very amusing sight, and Johnny shouted and laughed and
drummed on his father&rsquo;s chest with his shining little
boots, and <a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>stared about him at the seething mass of heads, and at
the horses thundering past, and at those other horses tied up in
pickets or rows, some of them plentifully bedecked with ribbons,
while the manes and tails of others were curiously ornamented
with straw.&nbsp; Over yonder were the booths and the tents and
the waggons, and the red-and-yellow roundabouts and the swings
and the shooting-galleries, and the crowds and crowds of merry
folk.&nbsp; Johnny&rsquo;s spirits rose more and more as the
moments passed, and he presently found himself obliged not only
to drum upon his father&rsquo;s chest, but to jig up and down
upon his shoulder, supporting himself by the crown of John
Reed&rsquo;s best Sunday hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold hard!&rdquo; cried his parent good-naturedly, when
a more than usually ecstatic movement had well-nigh bonneted
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sit still, my lad.&nbsp; Where be
climbin&rsquo; to, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo; at the roundabouts,&rdquo;
chanted Johnny; &ldquo;all the folks ridin&rsquo;, and the harses
goin&rsquo; up an&rsquo; down.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Maggie and
Jim&mdash;and Rosie a-ridin&rsquo; behind!&nbsp; O-o-oh, Dada, do
&rsquo;ee take I to &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a promise is a promise.&nbsp; I did say I&rsquo;d
take &rsquo;ee, didn&rsquo;t I?&nbsp; Come along, then jump
down!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the boy!&nbsp; Now we&rsquo;ll go.&nbsp;
<a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>Which
shall it be?&nbsp; That great, big, red un?&rdquo;&mdash;as the
child pointed with his small forefinger.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
make straight for he, then.&nbsp; Now, will &rsquo;ee ride in
front o&rsquo; Dada, or will &rsquo;ee have a horse all to
yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s eyes were growing rounder and rounder, and his
little hot hand clutched his father&rsquo;s finger with almost
feverish eagerness, as he answered stoutly that he&rsquo;d like
to ride all by his own self.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; cried Reed admiringly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t think the spirit of en,&rdquo; he
remarked to the red-faced proprietress of the merry-go-round as
he paid the fare.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;d think a little chap
same as this &rsquo;ud be afeared to go alone.&nbsp; But no, not
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to ride all by my own
self,&rsquo; says he, as cool as a cucumber&mdash;an&rsquo; him
but just turned four years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was pleasant to see the pair circling to the sound of the
diabolical music: the father perspiring with terror on the
child&rsquo;s account, with one great hand hovering over him,
ready to support him at the smallest sign of wavering, his own
huge form ridiculously out of proportion to his wooden steed, his
long legs trailing; the son, very red in the face, clutching the
wooden neck of his horse with strong, resolute <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>little
hands, his eyes bright with rapture, his mile growing broader and
broader until at length he was forced to chuckle aloud for
glee.</p>
<p>Well, they had two rides on the roundabout, and then they went
on the switchback, and then they went in a swing, and then Reed
bought a large flabby cake and a couple of very green apples, and
while Johnny was munching these dainties they suddenly knocked up
against an acquaintance whom his father had not seen for
years.&nbsp; There was much greeting and hand-shaking and
questioning&mdash;the two deep voices booming over the
child&rsquo;s head, which was now beginning to swim a little,
partly as a result of much agitation, and partly, perhaps,
because those very green apples began to make him feel rather
uncomfortable.</p>
<p>He hung more and more heavily on his father&rsquo;s hand, and
at last, his short legs giving way beneath him, he fairly dropped
on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gettin&rsquo; tired, eh?&rdquo; said Reed, glancing
down at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, we&rsquo;ll look for Maggie and
Rosie, and get &rsquo;em to take &rsquo;ee somewhere where ye can
sit down and rest for a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lifting him up, he threaded his way through the crowd,
followed by his new acquaintance.&nbsp; <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>Soon they
came upon the two girls, who, provided with an admirer apiece,
were gleefully &ldquo;shying&rdquo; at cocoanuts.</p>
<p>They readily agreed to take charge of Johnny, and their
father, turning to Jim Fry, informed him that he intended to
return home on foot, as he had met an old friend, and when they
had finished with the Fair they would probably go to the village
for a glass or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, sir, right,&rdquo; returned Jim amiably.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of the two young ladies, without Tom
Davis there likes to get up at the back along of Rosie to keep
the balance even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here Jim grinned and winked knowingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low he won&rsquo;t have no
objections,&rdquo; returned Reed good-humouredly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But ye must see and take &rsquo;em home afore dark, Jim,
same as ye did promise the missus.&nbsp; And take good care
o&rsquo; Johnny, maids, whatever ye do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny had by this time stared his fill at the cocoanuts, and
now came backing up against his father, turning suddenly as the
latter was about to move away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to stop with Dada!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let me go with you, Dada?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, he be ter&rsquo;ble fond o&rsquo; Dada, that he
be,&rdquo; remarked John to his friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>was such a
chap for wantin&rsquo; to be al&rsquo;ays at my heels.&nbsp;
There, but ye must stop with sister now, Johnny&mdash;and Dada
&rsquo;ull come back for &rsquo;ee by-and-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not keep the child out late, Father, will
ye?&rdquo; inquired Maggie anxiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll
let him come home wi&rsquo; us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he had already turned away.</p>
<p>Johnny was at first disposed to lament, but was somewhat
consoled on being invited to try his luck with the cocoanuts; the
sticks thrown by his small arm, however, fell wide of the mark,
and presently his lip began to droop again and his eyes to roam
wistfully,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you haven&rsquo;t spent your money yet,&rdquo;
cried Rosie, catching him up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, we&rsquo;ll go
to the stalls and find summat to buy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Johnny was perambulated up and down the stuffy arcade
between the rows of shouting, excited vendors of toys,
sweet-stuff, and crockery, after he had paused irresolutely in
front of several booths, and screwed and unscrewed his precious
little squeaking box any number of times, he found himself unable
to part with his threepenny-bit, and finally agreed, with a sigh
of satisfaction, to follow Rosie&rsquo;s advice and keep it for
another day.</p>
<p>They went to a shooting-gallery next, and <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>the noise
made Johnny&rsquo;s head ache; and then to a peep-show, which he
didn&rsquo;t understand; and then to watch an acrobatic
performance, which failed to interest him.</p>
<p>The day was wearing on now, and he was becoming very
tired.&nbsp; He dragged at his sister&rsquo;s skirts as he walked
beside her, and his head was ever turned backwards over his
shoulder in the hope of descrying &ldquo;Dada&rdquo;.&nbsp; Big
folk going past tumbled over him or pushed him to one side with
curt admonitory remarks.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, then, my
man!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Out of the way, youngster!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Look where you are going, can&rsquo;t you,
child?&rdquo;&nbsp; Even Maggie and Rosie, who were themselves
probably a little weary, began to lose patience with him, and
when, under his despairing clutch, the gathers of the elder
sister&rsquo;s dress gave way, she shook him, not roughly, but
irritably, and said sharply:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me, Johnny, hold up a bit, can&rsquo;t
&rsquo;ee?&nbsp; Jist see what ye&rsquo;ve a-done to my new
dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon all Johnny&rsquo;s stoicism gave way, and he began
to cry piteously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want Dada, I want
Dada!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s over there&mdash;see!&rdquo; cried Jim
Fry, who had found Johnny by no means a welcome addition to the
party.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look, <a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>Johnny, there&rsquo;s Dada
standin&rsquo; jist by that tent.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be
comin&rsquo; to fetch &rsquo;ee in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough the stalwart form of the elder John was plainly
discernible some fifty yards or so away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go to him!&rdquo; wailed the child.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I want to go to Dada&mdash;I <i>will</i> go to
Dada!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thrusting aside Maggie&rsquo;s hand, he broke from the
little group and ran at full speed towards the spot where his
father was standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best let him go,&rdquo; advised Jim, catching hold of
Maggie as she was about to start in pursuit.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be twice so happy wi&rsquo; he, and you know
your father did say he was a-comin&rsquo; back to fetch
en.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; assented she.</p>
<p>As they stood watching the little figure making its way among
the groups of people, Tom Davis came up in great excitement, with
Rosie on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man over there as is eatin&rsquo;
fire!&rdquo; he called out.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never see sich a thing
in my life!&nbsp; He be a-swallerin&rsquo; yards of it.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a kind of a ribbon, and he do set a light to one end,
and do put it in his mouth, and goes on a-swallerin&rsquo; and
a-swallerin&rsquo;!&nbsp; Ye never did see sich a thing!&nbsp;
His cheeks&mdash;there, ye can very nigh look through them!&nbsp;
Come <a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>quick, else it will be over.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ve a-been
doin&rsquo; all sorts o&rsquo; things&mdash;playin wi&rsquo;
knives and a-pullin&rsquo; rolls and rolls o&rsquo; coloured
ribbons out of his mouth.&nbsp; Dear heart alive, how he can keep
all they things inside of him I can&rsquo;t think!&nbsp; But come
along quick&mdash;this way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maggie turned her head for a last look at Johnny, who was by
this time but a few yards away from the tent near which John Reed
was standing; and then, deciding in her own mind that he was now
quite safe, hastened away with the others.</p>
<p>But Johnny was not quite safe: though so close to his father
that two or three of the latter&rsquo;s strides would have
covered the space between them, he was not destined to reach his
side that day.</p>
<p>Lo! just as he was preparing to uplift his shrill little voice
and call ecstatically on his parent, there was a sudden stampede
among the crowd, and Johnny found himself lifted off his
feet.&nbsp; One of the colts exposed for sale had broken loose,
and, excited by the strange medley of sights and sounds around
him, was galloping madly hither and thither, snorting and lashing
out with his heels.&nbsp; A big, bearded farmer had caught up the
little chap in his arms and ran with him out of harm&rsquo;s
way.&nbsp; <a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>In a few moments he halted breathless, and set the
child upon his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve caught en, I see,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;no fear now.&nbsp; There, give over hollerin&rsquo;, my
boy; nobody wants to hurt &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; If I hadn&rsquo;t
a-catched &rsquo;ee up ye&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been run
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny gave one scared look at the kind red face, shook off
the hand upon his shoulder, and then made off as fast as his
tired little legs would carry him in the direction of the tent
where he had last seen his father standing.&nbsp; But alas! no
father was to be seen, and the poor little fellow, wailing aloud,
began a fruitless search for him amid the throng.</p>
<p>He did not find him; perhaps because the elder John had
already left the Fair, perhaps because the younger, though he
imagined himself to be covering a large area, was in reality
wandering round and round about the same place.&nbsp; Nobody
noticed his continuous cry&mdash;there were many tired children
at Shroton Fair that day&mdash;and now that the dusk was
beginning to fall the heads of families were too busy gathering
together their own belongings to take heed of a fretful
stranger.&nbsp; So Johnny stumbled wearily along, and at last,
being thoroughly worn out, climbed into a wicker chair which
formed part of a large assortment <a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>of basket wares, and resolved to
wait until &ldquo;Dada&rdquo; came by.</p>
<p>Here he crouched with his legs tucked beneath him, his cap far
back on his dishevelled yellow locks, big tears hanging on his
eyelashes, and one little forefinger between his lips&mdash;the
picture of childish woe.</p>
<p>Every now and then he would fancy he descried the burly figure
of his father advancing towards him, and would crane his head
with an eager cry; but when the figure drew near it would always
prove to be that of a stranger, and then Johnny would sob, and
sink back again&mdash;a mere little heap of misery.</p>
<p>After long waiting and fruitless watching, Johnny&rsquo;s
little head began to droop, and his heavy lids closed gradually
over his blue eyes; he sank backwards in the low chair, and
presently forgot all his troubles in sleep.</p>
<p>It was quite dark when he was suddenly startled into
consciousness by the pressure of a heavy hand upon his shoulder,
and the sound of a rough voice in his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo&mdash;what&rsquo;s this?&nbsp; What be you
a-doin&rsquo; in my chair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silverlocks herself could not have been more bewildered by the
advent of the Three Bears than was Johnny as he sat up, blinking
<a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>at what
seemed to him a gigantic form dimly outlined in the dusk: he was
positively voiceless with terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who gave &rsquo;ee leave to go to sleep in my chair, ye
rascal?&rdquo; continued the new-comer, and in another moment the
little fellow&rsquo;s seat was lifted up, and his own small
person was sent sprawling on the ground.</p>
<p>Uttering a choked wail, the child scrambled to his feet and
gazed about him; all was strange, dark, and terrifying; undefined
shapes loomed through the dusk; the lights flashing out here and
there intensified the prevailing gloom; a babel of voices
intermingled with shouts and laughter sounded in the
distance.&nbsp; Two or three unknown figures now drew near to
him, and one stretched out its hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, little man, who may you be?&rdquo; said a
thick voice which he had never heard before.</p>
<p>Johnny started back, gasped, and then, terror lending him
wings, darted swiftly from the group and fled away into the
darkness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>When the time came for the young folks to return home, they
were much surprised to find that Reed did not appear to restore
Johnny to <a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>their care.&nbsp; After long waiting and searching in
the crowd, they decided that the little fellow must have
prevailed upon his sire to allow him to remain with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be hoped he&rsquo;ll not keep out the child too
long,&rdquo; said Maggie as she mounted the cart.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mother &rsquo;ull be awful upset at our goin&rsquo; back
wi&rsquo;out him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will&mdash;jist about!&rdquo; agreed Rosie
gloomily, from the back seat.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I
don&rsquo;t know however he&rsquo;ll manage to get en home,
without he carries en all the way, and he&rsquo;s a pretty good
weight, Johnny is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody &rsquo;ull give &rsquo;em a lift, you mid be
sure,&rdquo; said optimistic Tom, from his place next
Rosie.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis wonderful how things do fall
out.&nbsp; There now, d&rsquo;ye see, I never looked for
gettin&rsquo; a ride in sich pleasant company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he leered at Rosie in so meaning a manner that she tossed
her head and forgot all about her little brother.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed&rsquo;s indignation and anxiety knew no bounds, and
she was far from satisfied with the girls&rsquo;
explanation.&nbsp; Indeed, she rated them both soundly, refused
to hear any details of their doings, and dismissed them in
dudgeon to their little attic room, where, infected by <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>her alarm,
they lay quaking as the hours passed without bringing their
father.</p>
<p>Midnight had been proclaimed by the asthmatic cuckoo-clock,
and one had struck before the sound of heavy footsteps on the
path without awoke Maggie from the uneasy doze into which she had
at length fallen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis Father,&rdquo; she cried, sitting up in her
bed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lard! how he do fumble wi&rsquo; the
latch.&nbsp; He do seem to be a bit drinky, and he can&rsquo;t
have been druv, after all.&nbsp; He must ha&rsquo; carried Johnny
all the way.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a mercy if he haven&rsquo;t dropped
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They could hear their mother unbolting the house door, her
voice raised in querulous reproach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a shame for &rsquo;ee, John, to keep out the
child to this time o&rsquo; night.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then a sudden
cry.&nbsp; &ldquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sake, what ha&rsquo; ye done
wi&rsquo; him?&nbsp; Where be he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where be what?&rdquo; returned the father
good-humouredly, if a little thickly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Johnny?&nbsp;
Why he be at home and abed hours ago.&nbsp; I left en wi&rsquo;
the maids.&nbsp; They be come home, sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maggie&rsquo;s heart seemed to stand still; in a moment she
had thrown a shawl over her nightgown, and was pattering down the
narrow <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>stairs, Rosie following and sobbing aloud.&nbsp; They
burst into the kitchen.&nbsp; John Reed&rsquo;s tall figure was
standing in the open doorway, and though his wife, voiceless with
terror, was clutching him by the arm, actually shaking him in her
anxiety, he was smiling stupidly down at her, quite unconscious
of the effect produced by his announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ees,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;I left en
wi&rsquo; the maids, and they must ha&rsquo; started long afore
I.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell ye all about it&mdash;I did meet
Charl&rsquo; Pollen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; shrieked Maggie, &ldquo;ye don&rsquo;t
mean to say ye haven&rsquo;t got Johnny!&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t
with us!&nbsp; He ran off to you late in the afternoon.&nbsp; I
saw en close aside o&rsquo; you.&nbsp; Lard save us, what&rsquo;s
to be done!&nbsp; The child&rsquo;s lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost!&rdquo; repeated Reed, sobered in a minute.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rushed towards the girls, his face working, his eyes
bloodshot.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve been and lost that child
I&rsquo;ll be the death o&rsquo; you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was harsh, absolutely unlike itself; he could
scarcely articulate in his frenzy of rage and terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told &rsquo;ee,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I told
&rsquo;ee to look after en&mdash;my last words was, &lsquo;Take
care o&rsquo; <a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>Johnny, whatever ye do&rsquo;.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t dare
tell me ye&rsquo;ve been and lost en!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Father, Father!&rdquo; wailed Maggie, who had
retreated to the farthest end of the room, and now stood gazing
at him with eyes that seemed ready to start from her pallid
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Father, you did say you was a-comin&rsquo;
back for en, and he was a-cryin&rsquo; for you, and when he
catched sight o&rsquo; you he wouldn&rsquo;t be kept back all us
could say.&nbsp; And we stood and watched en till he was close
aside of &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; How could we but think he was
safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye shouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; let go of en for a
minute,&rdquo; thundered the father.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never set
eyes on en, I tell &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; My God! the child&rsquo;s
lost, sure enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sank down on the nearest chair, covering his face with his
hands, while the women stood huddled together with ghastly faces,
weeping and lamenting.&nbsp; Suddenly he sprang up again, turning
on them savagely:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could ye be sich fools as to think I&rsquo;d keep
him out till this hour?&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye fancy I&rsquo;d no
thought for en?&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye really think I&mdash;I could go
for to do anything as mid hurt en?&nbsp; Lard, to think on
it!&nbsp; Keep them maids o&rsquo; yourn out of my sight, Missus,
or upon my word I&rsquo;ll be the death of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>Mrs.
Reed&rsquo;s very soul was pierced by the cruelty of the words
&ldquo;Them maids o&rsquo; yours,&rdquo; which not only implied
her responsibility for the catastrophe, but seemed to portend a
kind of dissolution of partnership; but, nevertheless, she alone
of all the family retained a remnant of self-possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; she said tremulously,
&ldquo;what time was it when you see him last, maids?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six o&rsquo;clock, I think,&rdquo; gasped Maggie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; repeated Reed, dropping his
voice suddenly to a despairing note.&nbsp; &ldquo;Six
o&rsquo;clock and it&rsquo;s nigh upon two now!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s eight hours since he was seen or heard
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s there yet,&rdquo; cried the mother,
still striving to be hopeful.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
let&rsquo;s lose another moment, Father&mdash;let&rsquo;s go and
look for en straight off.&nbsp; Maybe he&rsquo;s crope into one
o&rsquo; the tents and fell asleep, or maybe somebody&rsquo;s
found en and is a-taken care of en.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
believe,&rdquo; added the poor woman wistfully, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe as any one could find it in their hearts for
to hurt a little chap like him&mdash;so pretty as he did look
too!&nbsp; Oh, dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face changed, and she caught her breath with a sudden
gasp.&nbsp; Her lip began to tremble, and she pressed her finger
to it to still it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He be too pretty,&rdquo; she said falteringly; <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>&ldquo;that&rsquo;s the worst on it!&nbsp; There be so
many gipsy folk about, and play-actors, and all sorts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother,&rdquo; cried Maggie and Rosie together,
&ldquo;ye don&rsquo;t think as anybody &rsquo;ud want to steal
en?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; she returned
almost inarticulately; &ldquo;there, maybe they wouldn&rsquo;t,
but they do tell sich tales, and Johnny did look sich a
pictur&rsquo;, ye know; we was a-sayin&rsquo; it
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Reed uttered such a heart-rending groan upon this that
the girls, forgetful of their terror, ran towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep off, I say!&rdquo; he cried savagely, springing
from his chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Keep off!&mdash;keep out of my
sight&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what I mid do to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, my dears,&rdquo; interposed their mother, in a
tremulous aside, &ldquo;best not anger him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not
himself, d&rsquo;ye see.&nbsp; Run upstairs and get your things
on, and see if ye can rouse up any of the neighbours to come and
help look for the child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not wait for nobody&rsquo;s help!&rdquo;
growled her husband, catching at the words.&nbsp; &ldquo;I be
goin&rsquo; to look for my child myself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not
a-goin&rsquo; to take none o&rsquo; you wi&rsquo; me&mdash;ye
don&rsquo;t <a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>deserve it.&nbsp; Ye didn&rsquo;t, none o&rsquo; ye,
vally that child as ye did ought to ha&rsquo; vallyed him, and
now he be lost, and ye don&rsquo;t none o&rsquo; ye deserve to
find en.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The women-folk gazed at each other aghast, but before they
could remonstrate he was gone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>Day was dawning in all the cool glamour of fine September; a
milky sky, that would presently become brilliant blue, a
dew-drenched landscape; trees and pasture alike
silver-besprent.&nbsp; Robins were already singing in the boughs,
and the sparrows had long been awake and busy, when a party of
workmen, each with spade and pick on shoulder, sauntered across
the fields to the scene of their daily labours.&nbsp; As they
walked they could hear the stir and bustle at Shroton&mdash;no
great distance away.&nbsp; The Fair had ended on the preceding
night, and the travelling folk were busily collecting their gear,
and preparing for the road.&nbsp; Many shows and gipsy vans had,
indeed, departed long before it was light, and from time to time
the clatter of a traction-engine, the shriek of a steam-whistle,
a column of noisome smoke poisoning the air above the green-gold
line of hedge which bordered the highway, indicated <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>the
retirement of some unusually important merry-go-round or
switchback.</p>
<p>The men had all paid a visit to the fair on one or other of
the two days previous, and were discussing with some eagerness
and occasional bursts of laughter the various frolics in which
each had taken part, when they arrived at their goal.</p>
<p>Their task, unusual enough in itself, did not seem strange to
them.&nbsp; They were removing soil and rubbish from the recently
discovered remains of a Roman villa.</p>
<p>Roman remains were common enough in that neighbourhood;
antiquarians had even gloated over traces of still earlier
times.&nbsp; Thigh-bones, which were recognised to be of Danish
origin, skulls of ancient Britons, had been found and treasured;
there were undeniable traces, not far from this particular spot,
of a hamlet once occupied by some almost prehistoric race.&nbsp;
No wonder, therefore, that the excavation of a mere Roman villa
was an event comparatively unimportant!</p>
<p>Yet when the foremost workman reached the spot and looked down
at the scene of his previous labours, he uttered a long, shrill
whistle, and, turning to his comrades, exclaimed:&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blowed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; cried another, pressing forward
in his turn.</p>
<p>The rest hastened after him, and soon all were bending forward
looking into the pit, the depth of which varied from five to six
feet.&nbsp; What was it that had called forth their
astonishment?&nbsp; The ancient walls, which each day&rsquo;s
toil exposed more fully, had now become familiar to them; they
had often noticed the lines of colour traced by some alien hand
so many centuries before, yet still bright and distinct where the
sunshine caught them: they were not prone to marvel at these
things at any time, and certainly not now when the modern wonders
at the Fair were still fresh in their memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how ever did he get there?&rdquo; cried the first
speaker, pointing downwards with his thumb as the long-dead
proprietor of those ancient walls might once have pointed at some
doomed gladiator.</p>
<p>There, amid the relics of a bygone civilisation, lay the
chubby form of a little nineteenth-century child&mdash;an
extremely modern little Briton in a sailor-suit, with a mop of
yellow curls tumbling over his sleeping face.</p>
<p>Yes, there lay Johnny!&nbsp; While his distracted <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>father was
scouring the roads; while his mother and sisters, frantic with
grief, had passed the night in wandering from house to house
beating up search-parties, Johnny was sleeping the sweet, sound
sleep of the tired child, on a heap of soft earth at the bottom
of the Roman villa.</p>
<p>On hearing the strange voices he sat up, and looked about him,
rosy and dewy after his slumbers.&nbsp; The night had been mild,
and he had rolled himself up so tightly that he had contrived to
keep warm.&nbsp; He blinked in bewilderment at the bright
sunshine and at the strange bearded faces.&nbsp; Then, with
returning consciousness, the thought which had been last present
to his mind before sleep had overtaken him leaped back to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want Dada,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how in the name o&rsquo; fortun&rsquo; did you get
here?&rdquo; cried one of the men, swinging himself over the
side, and taking the child up in his arms.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you
been here all night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like it,&rdquo; cried another.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, little man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; said the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did ye come here, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the man was arter me, and I <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>couldn&rsquo;t find Dada,&rdquo; said Johnny.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I looked and looked, an&rsquo; it was dark, and I was
running, and I falled down here and I couldn&rsquo;t get out
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what a tale!&nbsp; The little chap&rsquo;s lost
hisself, d&rsquo;ye see, mates?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s somebody in
trouble about this &rsquo;ere, you mid be sure!&nbsp;
Somebody&rsquo;s lost en at the Fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, he don&rsquo;t look as if he belonged to any
o&rsquo; the gipsy folk, or the shows, or sich as them,&rdquo;
said somebody.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seems as if he did belong to decent
folks.&nbsp; They be lookin&rsquo; for en at Shroton most
like&mdash;we&rsquo;d best take en back there.&nbsp; He
don&rsquo;t belong to nobody about here, that&rsquo;s
plain.&nbsp; Where d&rsquo;ye live, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next door to Mrs. Short,&rdquo; returned the child
promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s tellin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s the name o&rsquo; the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny, who was chary of speech at all times, and was besides
slightly alarmed at being interrogated by so many strangers,
returned no answer to this query, and announced instead loudly,
and with a hint of not far distant tears in his voice, that he
wanted &ldquo;<i>Dada</i>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, best take en to the Fair at once,&rdquo; said
the man who held him in his arms.&nbsp; <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s sure to be some of his folks
about.&nbsp; Come along, Johnny&mdash;we&rsquo;ll go and look for
Dada.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hoisted up the child to one of his comrades, clambered
himself to the higher level, and, taking him again in his arms,
set off for the scene of the Fair, the others looking after him
curiously for a moment or two, and then leisurely setting about
their work.</p>
<p>Johnny did not say much during the transit; he sat very
upright, staring about him with all his eyes in his anxiety to
catch the first glimpse of his father.</p>
<p>As they entered the field where the Fair had taken place, and
where were still many groups of busy people, a sudden outcry
sounded from the neighbourhood of one of the large gipsy-vans
which stood horsed and ready for further progress.&nbsp; A great
red-bearded man, with a white face and wild, bloodshot eyes, was
struggling in the midst of the little crowd which had closed
about him, while the proprietor of the van, a swarthy, thick-set
fellow, was evidently denouncing him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Dada!&rdquo; cried Johnny eagerly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There he is!&nbsp; What are they doing to en?&nbsp; Why
are they holdin&rsquo; en?&nbsp; Dada!&rdquo; he cried in a
shrill scream.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dada!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>Amid
all his frenzy, aye, even amid the din about him, John Reed
distinguished the little voice, and suddenly became as a
lamb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis him,&rdquo; he cried brokenly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis Johnny!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s him yonder,&rdquo;
and slipping from the loosened grasp of the hands which had been
laid upon him, he staggered forward, paused, wavered, and then
dropping to the ground burst into tears.</p>
<p>Johnny, having been set on his legs, ran gleefully to his
father, and flung his arms about his neck; and John fondled him
with one big trembling hand, and sobbed on, his broad shoulders
heaving, the tears trickling through the brown fingers with which
he sought to hide his face.</p>
<p>People who had been most ready to condemn him now gathered
round, full of sympathy; even the policemen, fathers of families
themselves, looked down with benign compassion.&nbsp; Only the
van-proprietor stood aloof, indignantly surveying the tattered
collar of his own rusty jacket, which seemed, indeed, to have
recently sustained severe handling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was near the death o&rsquo; me, I know that,&rdquo;
he remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;d no need to come
assaultin&rsquo; and a-batterin&rsquo; of me, if he had a-lost
his child.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t know what he was
a-doin&rsquo;,&rdquo; returned a sympathetic bystander.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ve a-bin all night runnin&rsquo; after vans and
sich, thinkin&rsquo; they&rsquo;d a-carried off the little
chap.&nbsp; Somebody went and told en there was a little kid
wi&rsquo; yaller curls among your folks, and he made sure
&rsquo;twas his, d&rsquo;ye see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, an&rsquo; if we do have a kid wi&rsquo; yaller
curls, what&rsquo;s that to he?&rdquo; grumbled the other.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Us have got brats enough of our own wi&rsquo;out
wantin&rsquo; strangers.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have compensation for
this.&nbsp; I bain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to be assaulted and
a-battered for nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nearest policeman, a portly personage, and jealous of his
prerogative, now turning in a dignified manner, informed the
malcontent that he didn&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; what
he was talkin&rsquo; of&mdash;compensation didn&rsquo;t apply to
no such case as this, and finally ordered him sternly to move
on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Reed had somewhat recovered, and was looking about
him with red, swollen eyes, and explaining huskily to the crowd
as he hugged Johnny in his arms:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d lost en, d&rsquo;ye
see?&mdash;that&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; I thought I&rsquo;d lost
en.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rising presently, he prepared to leave the field,
Johnny&rsquo;s whilom protector walking beside <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>him,
relating over and over again how he had come upon the child, how
surprised he had been, how he had said to his mates that there
was sure to be somebody in trouble about this, and how he had
thought it best to come to the Fair at once.&nbsp; Reed,
listening in a dazed kind of way, folded his arms tighter about
Johnny, and stumbled along almost like a man in a dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I carry him?&rdquo; said the other
suddenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye do seem that upset I reckon ye&rsquo;d
get along easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then John woke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;nay, sir.&nbsp; I thank
&rsquo;ee kindly&mdash;I thank &rsquo;ee from my heart for
findin&rsquo; en and all&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t let go of
en.&nbsp; I must have the feel of en, ye see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they turned out of the gate a sudden rattle of wheels was
heard and a trap came in sight, the horse proceeding at a kind of
hobbling canter, and one of the occupants of the little vehicle
actually standing upright and supporting herself by the shoulder
of the driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis Mammy, I do believe,&rdquo; said Reed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;See, Johnny&mdash;and there&rsquo;s Maggie and Rosie at
back.&nbsp; Call out to &rsquo;em, Sonny!&nbsp; Holler
loud.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s come to me, I
can&rsquo;t seem to get my voice out.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>Johnny duly raised his shrill pipe, and in another
moment, with a joyful whoop, Jim Fry had thrown the reins on the
horse&rsquo;s back, and the whole party had tumbled into the
road.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed and Rosie were beside Dada and his precious burden
almost immediately, but Maggie hung back, looking at her father
with piteous, appealing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, Maidy,&rdquo; he said huskily,
&ldquo;come&mdash;all&rsquo;s forgive and forgot&mdash;there be
summat to forgive and forget on all sides.&nbsp; I were a bit
rough to &rsquo;ee last night, but there, d&rsquo;ye see, I were
very nigh out o&rsquo; my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maggie made a clutch at the nearest available portion of
Johnny&rsquo;s person, which happened to be a sturdy little
mottled leg&mdash;for he was positively swamped by the caresses
of his family&mdash;stooped, kissed it, and burst into tears.</p>
<p>Rosie followed suit, the mother had been long ago weeping, and
now John Reed himself began to gulp and make contortions of the
face as though in preparation for a fresh outburst of
emotion.</p>
<p>Poor little Johnny looked from one to the other, utterly
bewildered.&nbsp; The sight of his whole family simultaneously in
tears was too much for him, and, lifting up his voice, he <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>gave vent
to his feelings in a volume of sound which left no doubt as to
the unimpaired condition of his lungs even after a night under
the stars.</p>
<p>Jim Fry had been circling round the group scratching his head,
rubbing his nose, and screwing up his mouth in token of
dissatisfaction.&nbsp; At this juncture he thought it was time to
interfere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never,&rdquo; he remarked irritably, &ldquo;I
never did see sich folk.&nbsp; Here we&rsquo;ve all been
a-trapesing over the county lookin&rsquo; for the child, and
thinkin&rsquo; him dead or stole, or hurted some way; and now
we&rsquo;ve a-found en safe and sound, wi&rsquo;out so much as a
scratch on en, and ye must all begin a-cryin&rsquo; and
a-sobbin&rsquo; enough to frighten en out of his wits.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t what ye&rsquo;d like, be it,
Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Johnny, with such a heave of his little
chest that it very nearly lifted him out of his father&rsquo;s
arms.&nbsp; Again he looked from one to the other with tearful,
bewildered eyes, and again the sense of his injuries was too much
for him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like&mdash;summat&mdash;to
eat!&rdquo; he announced in a bellow of wrath and woe.</p>
<p>And thereupon the whole simple family fell a-laughing; and
once again Johnny was hugged <a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>all round, and though eyes were
still wet, and every now and then there would be a little catch
in the voice of one or other speaker, the general equanimity was
restored, and the party fell to discussing the little boy&rsquo;s
practical suggestion.</p>
<p>It was a very happy family that presently sat down to
breakfast in a neighbouring cottage, Johnny being handed with
respectful tenderness from one to the other, and being disposed
before the meal was out to look upon himself quite in the light
of a hero.&nbsp; And Maggie sat between her father and Jim Fry,
and was perhaps the happiest of all.</p>
<h2><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>THE
ROUT OF THE CONQUEROR.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> log fire burnt cheerily on the
wide hearth, hissing and crackling every now and then, and
sending showers of sparks dancing up the chimney; casting
flickering shadows on the low ceiling, and sportively throwing
little dots and rims of light from one to the other of Betty
Sibley&rsquo;s cherished treasures of crockery ware.&nbsp; But
Betty herself looked very serious as she sat leaning forward in
her arm-chair, her bony elbows resting on her knees, her pointed
chin supported by her hands, her beady black eyes roving from one
to the other of her two visitors.</p>
<p>They sat on the opposite side of the hearth.&nbsp; One a
portly, middle-aged woman with a white apron much in evidence,
and a little shawl crossed over her shoulders.&nbsp; The strings
of her very flat straw bonnet were untied and thrown back, an
infallible token of perturbation of mind in the class to which
she belonged, her large fat hands tightly clasped together on the
top of her apron, her woebegone face <a name="page254"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 254</span>with its lack-lustre eyes and
loosely-dropping lower lip, the very picture of helpless
despondency.&nbsp; Close beside her, on the extreme edge of his
chair, sat a young man sufficiently like her to be recognisable
as her son, but with considerably more intelligence in his
face&mdash;intelligence dashed at this moment by a marked
expression of sullenness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Aunt Betty, if you can&rsquo;t help us, I&rsquo;m
sure I can&rsquo;t think whatever we be to do.&nbsp; You was
always so clever&mdash;they do say down yonder in village there
bain&rsquo;t nothing as Betty Sibley haven&rsquo;t got some way
o&rsquo; gettin&rsquo; round.&nbsp; She can very nigh make the
dead alive again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay now, I never went so far as that,&rdquo; said old
Betty, throwing herself back in her chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;ve brought back them as has gone to the New House just
for a minute like to ax a question.&nbsp; Sometimes the end comes
so suddent there bain&rsquo;t no time for things to get settled
as they should be settled, and as them as is gone ud&rsquo; wish
to have them settled&mdash;well, then, there&rsquo;s ways
o&rsquo; makin&rsquo; them come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor!&rdquo; ejaculated Kate Hardy under her breath,
looking in awe at her distinguished relative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ees, my dear, you mid be sure o&rsquo;
that.&nbsp; <a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>D&rsquo;ye mind when poor Jane Arnold was took off
wi&rsquo; an impression on her chest&mdash;not so much time as to
say where she&rsquo;d like to be buried?&nbsp; Well, ye know, her
daughter Mary was terrible upset.&nbsp; She know&rsquo;d her
mother had a lovely set o&rsquo; silver spoons put away safe
somewhere, what was to be hers as she did tell her many a time
when she was livin&rsquo;, but not so much as one o&rsquo; them
could she find; and Tom, the brother&mdash;a very rough fellow
was Tom&mdash;gived her a week to put all to rights in the house
and to pack up and go.&nbsp; Him and his missus didn&rsquo;t get
on at all with Mary.&nbsp; So poor Mary did come to I, the tears
a-streaming down her face.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mrs. Sibley,&rsquo; says
she, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ll do without
you&rsquo;ll help me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve lost my dear
mother,&rsquo; she says, a-sobbin&rsquo; and a-cryin&rsquo; fit
to break her heart, &lsquo;and now it do really seem as if I was
to lose the spoons too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh&mdash;h&mdash;h, dear, dear,&rdquo; groaned Mrs.
Hardy sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E&mdash;es, my dear, it &rsquo;ud ha&rsquo;
melted a heart o&rsquo; stone I do assure ye.&nbsp; So, I gived
her summat and I did tell her what to say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the young man who had been sitting moodily twirling his
thumbs, only changing his position once or twice to kick the
burning <a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>logs with the heel of his hob-nailed boot when the
flames sunk low, looked up suddenly with an expression of
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did &rsquo;ee give her?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind, Jim.&nbsp; It bain&rsquo;t for
nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; that kind as you and your mother be come
here this evenin&rsquo;: &rsquo;tis the livin&rsquo; as you wants
to deal wi&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe if I had my will it &rsquo;ud be the dead,&rdquo;
said Jim, kicking savagely at the log.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh&mdash;sh&mdash;sh,&rdquo; said his mother
reprovingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee take no notice of
him, Aunt Betty; &rsquo;tis the best hearted bwoy in the world,
but there, he be druv&rsquo; very nigh distracted at the present
time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Kate, my dear, as I was a-sayin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
pursued the sibyl, pointedly addressing herself to the elder of
her visitors, &ldquo;I did give the poor creatur&rsquo; summat,
and that very night about twelve o&rsquo;clock she did set the
charm to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim kicked at the log again, a little nervously, and Kate drew
forward her chair with a grating sound on the tiled floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jist as the clock did strike one,&rdquo; went on Betty,
in a sepulchral tone, &ldquo;the flame o&rsquo; the candle did
jump up and then drop down again, and Mary did hear her
mother&rsquo;s step on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>Murmurs of admiration mingled with trepidation from
Mrs. Hardy, and a sudden rigidity on Jim&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she was, jist as she mid ha&rsquo; been in life,
in her Sunday dress an&rsquo; little brooch an&rsquo; all, Mary
said, an&rsquo; a nice clean apron, an&rsquo; wi&rsquo; a
beautiful fresh colour in her cheeks.&nbsp; She looked at Mary so
reproachful like, the very same, Mary did say, as if she was
axin&rsquo; her, &lsquo;Why have ye brought me back?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Poor Mary did go all white and twittery, an&rsquo; she did say:
&lsquo;Oh, Mother dear, I&rsquo;d never ha&rsquo; brought you
back from your rest, but just to ax &rsquo;ee the one thing:
<i>where did &rsquo;ee put the spoons</i>?&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, the
figure did stand lookin&rsquo; at her so solemn, and then all at
once did rise its hand like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Betty pointed upwards, and a dramatic pause ensued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; groaned Mrs. Hardy, &ldquo;meanin&rsquo; to
say as now she&rsquo;d gone up&rsquo;ards to glory she
couldn&rsquo;t be expected to be took up wi&rsquo; spoons
an&rsquo; sich like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas the very thing as Mary did think herself,
Kate my dear,&rdquo; responded Betty solemnly.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
come to I next mornin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; she did say them very
words, but I knowed better; I knowed that there charm what I
gived her was one as never failed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not at <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>all,
Mary,&rsquo; says I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your mother&rsquo;s sperrit
warn&rsquo;t a-tellin&rsquo; &rsquo;ee nought o&rsquo; the
kind.&nbsp; It p&rsquo;inted up&rsquo;ards, ye say?&nbsp; Well
then, take my advice an&rsquo; go straight home and <i>search the
thatch</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to be sure!&rdquo; ejaculated her listeners; even
the taciturn Jim was constrained to express some interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she find &rsquo;em?&rdquo; he asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think she did find &rsquo;em, Jim.&nbsp; She
did find every one as safe as anything, tied up in an old
stocking, jist in the very spot what her mother had p&rsquo;inted
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This climax seemed to impress Jim even more than his mother;
he leaned forward, his great red hands twitching as they rested
one on each knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low, Aunt Betty, if ye could do that,
you could do anythin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t ye gi&rsquo; me
summat as &rsquo;ll get the better o&rsquo; this here
chap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jim, I could give &rsquo;ee a love charm, but as
you do tell I there&rsquo;s no gettin&rsquo; near your young
lady, I don&rsquo;t see how you be to indooce her to wear
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; put in Jim&rsquo;s mother
dolefully.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, I will say it do seem cruel
hard.&nbsp; They were as good friends I do assure &rsquo;ee as a
young man and a young lady need be.&nbsp; <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>They&rsquo;ve a-bin walkin&rsquo;&mdash;how long have
you an&rsquo; Chrissy bin a-walkin&rsquo;, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen month,&rdquo; growled Jim gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, fifteen month, Aunt Betty.&nbsp; An&rsquo; Chrissy
have a nice bit of money laid by, mind ye.&nbsp; Her father was
as pleasant as could be about it, an&rsquo; quite friendly,
an&rsquo; the mother too.&nbsp; She did say to I not above a
month ago, I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;we may
be expectin&rsquo; to hear banns give out soon,&rsquo; she
says.&nbsp; Well, an now this young good-for-nothin&rsquo; chap
must come and whip her up from under my Jim&rsquo;s very
nose.&nbsp; What she can see in him I can&rsquo;t think, without
it be his <i>korky</i> jacket.&nbsp; <i>Trooper</i> Willcocks, as
he calls himself&mdash;I&rsquo;d troop him if I had my way.&nbsp;
Why didn&rsquo;t he stay out at the war then, if he be so set up
about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, he&rsquo;s a soldier, is he?&rdquo; commented Aunt
Betty.&nbsp; &ldquo;A soldier.&nbsp; Ah, my dear, Jim&rsquo;s
young lady bain&rsquo;t the first to run after a red
coat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he han&rsquo;t got no more a red coat nor you
have&mdash;nothin&rsquo; but what they do call korky&mdash;as
ugly a colour as ever I see.&nbsp; An&rsquo; he bain&rsquo;t
a-goin&rsquo; to stop in the army neither.&nbsp; He bain&rsquo;t
a proper soldier at all&mdash;jist a common chap as they picked
up somewhere and clapped on a horse and sent out.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the yeomanry,&rdquo; explained
Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t even come from these parts;
he&rsquo;s home on sick leave, an&rsquo; is here visitin&rsquo;
his uncle, along of his own &rsquo;ome bein&rsquo; in town and
not so healthy.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s no more sick than I
am.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to make him a bit sicker, I know.&nbsp;
Couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee give me a charm for that, Aunt
Betty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty rubbed her shrivelled hands together, and fixed her
beady eyes meditatively on her great-nephew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There mid be things as can be done what mid be things a
body midn&rsquo;t like doin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said
oracularly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know the wax image&mdash;but there,
I wouldn&rsquo;t go for to advise such a thing.&nbsp; The power
as is give us is give us for good, that&rsquo;s what I do
say.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a cure for everything in natur&rsquo;,
if one but knowed how to find it.&nbsp; Now with
herbs&mdash;I&rsquo;ve often found out wonderful things with
herbs&mdash;folks as is troubled wi&rsquo; warts and corns could
cure them in a minute if they knowed the right thing.&nbsp; The
worst wart as ever was can be cured by a bit o&rsquo;
milkwort.&nbsp; Pull it up, root an&rsquo; all, d&rsquo;ye see,
and give &rsquo;em a bit every day, pounded wi&rsquo; a drop
o&rsquo; new milk, an&rsquo; when the time comes round that the
plant, if it was growin&rsquo; outside, &rsquo;ud be dyin&rsquo;
down, the <a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>wart &rsquo;ull just wither away&mdash;that&rsquo;s my
<i>notion</i>, d&rsquo;ye see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the image,&rdquo; persevered Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did
you ever try that?&nbsp; It seems a silly kind o&rsquo; thing
too,&rdquo; he added tentatively.&nbsp; &ldquo;How could a dumb
image do anything good or ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush&mdash;sh&mdash;sh, my dear, ye don&rsquo;t know
nothin&rsquo; about them things,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Hardy with
apologetic haste.&nbsp; &ldquo;But they was known an&rsquo; tried
by others afore ye was born.&nbsp; Ye make an image in the
likeness of the person as you know is trying to do you harm, and
ye put it down to roast at a slow fire.&nbsp; Dear yes,
I&rsquo;ve often heard of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then ye don&rsquo;t seem to have heard the rights
on it,&rdquo; interposed Aunt Betty, indignant at this
encroachment on her peculiar province.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a deal more to be done than just set it down to roast
same&rsquo;s a chicken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what must ye do?&rdquo; inquired Kate in
awe-struck tones.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; seized by a sudden
thought, &ldquo;I can mind it now.&nbsp; Ye must stick the image
full of pins first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it?&rdquo; said old Betty, nodding
reluctantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s more than that
too.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s summat as must be
<i>said</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heerd tell o&rsquo; nothin bein&rsquo; said,
an&rsquo; <a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>I can mind my cousin Lizzie castin&rsquo; a spell over
her step-mother wi&rsquo; an image like that, an&rsquo; she were
took wi&rsquo; the rheumatiz the next week an&rsquo; never looked
up arter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twarn&rsquo;t on account of the spell then if
she didn&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; retorted Betty
contemptuously.&nbsp; &ldquo;No spell would ever work
wi&rsquo;out the words.&nbsp; Why, did ye never hear tell
o&rsquo; saying the Lard&rsquo;s Prayer back&rsquo;ards,
beginnin&rsquo; with Amen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lard no! that I didn&rsquo;t!&nbsp; An&rsquo; it
bain&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;d like to be doin&rsquo;, Aunt
Betty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither should I, my dear&mdash;&rsquo;tis just what I
be a-tellin&rsquo; &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; But charm won&rsquo;t work
wi&rsquo;out ye do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pause ensued, after which Kate, rising disconsolately and
crooking her arm into her heavy market-basket, remarked that it
was time to be goin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Jim rose too, and stood
dismally facing his great-aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ye like to come back in a few days I&rsquo;ll get
that love charm ready,&rdquo; she remarked compassionately.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bain&rsquo;t there no maid as knows her as ye could get to
sew it somewhere about her clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; retorted Jim sullenly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not try no love charms.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll try my
hand at gettin&rsquo; rid o&rsquo; <i>him</i> first.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>Mother and son trudged away together in gloomy
silence.&nbsp; The early dusk had closed in upon the autumnal
landscape.&nbsp; In the little town they had left behind, lights
were beginning to gleam forth, but before them there was only the
dim glimmer of the wet road to guide them on their way.&nbsp; Now
and then a van passed them, jogging downwards to the town, or a
heavily-laden waggon with the carter slouching alongside, and
growling out Good-night as he went by.</p>
<p>All at once Jim nudged his mother, and pointed with a
trembling finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely.&nbsp;
Against the uncertain grey background of the road a
broad-shouldered young figure came swinging into sight, the
outline of the broad-brimmed cavalier hat which marked the yeoman
being plainly perceptible.&nbsp; As he drew near to the couple he
paused, peering through the dusk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Jim Hardy!&rdquo; he cried gaily, &ldquo;any
message for Chrissy?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad to see you walking with
a lady&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell her you&rsquo;ve picked up another
sweetheart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out with &rsquo;ee, do!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Hardy,
further relieving her lacerated feelings by making a swoop at him
with the market-basket.</p>
<p><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>Jim,
however, pushed past her, and making a sudden dart at his
supplanter, endeavoured to knock the picturesque hat from his
head.&nbsp; But the yeoman was too quick for him: stepping
swiftly to one side he allowed his assailant&rsquo;s blow to
expend itself on the empty air, and then closing with him,
tripped him up and laid him neatly on his back in the miry
road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good trick that, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he inquired
pleasantly over his shoulder as he pursued his way.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Picked it up from the Lancashires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim lay half stunned for a moment and then struggled up,
foaming at the mouth.&nbsp; He would have rushed in pursuit of
his adversary, but that before he was fairly on his feet his
mother fell upon him, market-basket and all, and held him firmly
embraced until the tantalising sound of Trooper Willcocks&rsquo;
cheery whistle died away in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I tell you what it is,&rdquo; grumbled the
hapless lover, when he had at last extricated himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a try at that there image to-night, or my
name bain&rsquo;t Jim Hardy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening accordingly, when the rheumatic old father had
been hustled off to bed, and the younger members of the family
disposed of <a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>for the night, Jim confronted his mother, holding a
large slab of bees&rsquo; wax in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where be the pins?&rdquo; he asked in a fierce
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lard, it do make I go all flittery-twittery&mdash;folks
do tell such tales!&nbsp; If &rsquo;twarn&rsquo;t for
sayin&rsquo; the words, I wouldn&rsquo;t so much mind.&nbsp; But
there&mdash;the notion do make I go quite cold down the
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Jim, kneeling in front of the fire, had melted the
wax sufficiently to make it malleable, and now began to knead and
mould it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here be his legs,&rdquo; he muttered to himself,
&ldquo;and now we must make thiccy hat stick out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a kind of groan his mother went over to a chest of
drawers in a corner of the room, and after fumbling for some time
returned with a paper of pins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be very nigh ready,&rdquo; whispered Jim working
away.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ugh! I&rsquo;d like to smash the cheeky face
of &rsquo;en.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with that he gave a fierce poke at
the small knob which did duty for the gallant yeoman&rsquo;s
countenance.</p>
<p>The figure being completed Mrs. Hardy bent downwards handing
Jim the pins one by one; her son viciously proceeding to insert
as many as the effigy would hold, and beginning by <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>driving a
particularly large and crooked one into the middle of its
chest.&nbsp; The blazing logs threw large grotesque shadows of
the stooping forms of the mother and son upon walls and ceiling,
and when presently Jim held out the bristling little image at
arm&rsquo;s length, its fantastic reproduction, naturally much
magnified, did indeed appear to bear some weird resemblance to
the person whom it was meant to represent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, Mother, say the words,&rdquo; ordered Jim, as
he set down the figure on the hearth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lard, I dursn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; whimpered Mrs.
Hardy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say &rsquo;em yourself; I don&rsquo;t wish
the poor young man no &rsquo;arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her son, after casting on her a withering glance, indicative
of supreme scorn at this despicable attempt to shirk
responsibility, began slowly and resolutely to repeat his impious
incantation.&nbsp; By the time he had finished, the miniature
yeoman had considerably diminished in size, the broad-brimmed hat
had toppled to one side, and several of the pins had dropped
out.&nbsp; Jim straightened himself; his face was quite pale and
his brow was wet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get along to bed, Mother,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;I
reckon he&rsquo;ll do now.&nbsp; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low Trooper
Willcocks &rsquo;ull not feel so very comfortable in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>But
lo and behold! though on the following day nothing was left of
the effigy but a sticky indistinguishable mass of wax and pins,
the very first person whom Jim encountered on his way to work was
Trooper Willcocks, apparently in the best of health and
spirits.&nbsp; Jim was downcast, but not yet doubtful.&nbsp; He
would give him a week, he thought; but at the end of the week
Trooper Willcocks looked better than ever, and what was worse,
was more frequently in Chrissy&rsquo;s company.</p>
<p>The despairing lover next resolved to try a more orthodox
method of removing his obnoxious rival, and called upon the
Rector, to whom he unfolded his case with some difficulty, and
who listened in evident amusement, but not very great
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth, Hardy,&rdquo; he remarked,
throwing himself back in his chair, &ldquo;you are not the only
sufferer.&nbsp; I think about six men have already come to me on
the very same errand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six chaps come to ye about Chrissy Baverstock?&rdquo;
stammered Jim, purple in the face with anguish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not about Chrissy Baverstock&mdash;if I remember aright
each had a complaint to make about a different young woman, but
it was <a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>always the same man.&nbsp; He must be a redoubtable
fellow, this yeoman of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He bain&rsquo;t none o&rsquo; mine,&rdquo; retorted
Jim, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t think whatever the maids do
see in him.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know there was more nor
one,&rdquo; he added reflectively, while a ray of hope seemed to
illuminate his visage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry for you, but I&rsquo;m afraid I
can&rsquo;t help you.&nbsp; You see Willcocks is no parishioner
of mine.&nbsp; And though I have spoken to some of the girls in
question, my words seem to have no effect.&nbsp; Their heads are
turned, I think, by his tales of battles and dangers and
hairbreadth escapes.&nbsp; They make a hero of him.&nbsp; But
console yourself.&nbsp; After all there is safety in
numbers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ees,&rdquo; agreed Jim meditatively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s six of us, we ought to be able to do
summat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was late when he left the rectory, and he bent his steps
immediately to a small hostelry in the town, which he
occasionally patronised, but which the condition of his spirits
had not permitted him to frequent of late, dreading as he did the
facetious remarks of his cronies.</p>
<p>On pushing open the swing door, he found himself at once in
the midst of a party of heated disputants, and the first phrase
which greeted his ears revealed that the subject of <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>the
argument was the very one which occupied his own thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low I&rsquo;d knock that there
blasted, broad-brimmed hat off his head so soon as I&rsquo;d look
at en&mdash;and his head too if it comes to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; growled another, &ldquo;I be pure sorry they
Boers haven&rsquo;t a-done it for en.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t believe
they be such good shots as they do say, or they&rsquo;d ha&rsquo;
had it off afore now, wi&rsquo; their guns and their
cannons.&nbsp; It be always a poppin&rsquo; up where it
bain&rsquo;t wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haw&mdash;haw,&rdquo; chimed in a third voice, &ldquo;I
d&rsquo; &rsquo;low Trooper Willcocks&rsquo; head were a deal too
nigh Rosie Adlam&rsquo;s last night to suit &rsquo;ee, Tom.&nbsp;
Ah, &rsquo;twas a very tender sight, goin&rsquo; along by the top
of the hedge&mdash;d&rsquo;you mind, Billy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; poor Chrissy Baverstock standin&rsquo; all
alone at the corner of the lane, fit to bu&rsquo;st wi&rsquo;
jealousy&mdash;why that&rsquo;s Jim Hardy, bain&rsquo;t it?&nbsp;
We was just a-talkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; your girl, Jim; &rsquo;tis a
pity you weren&rsquo;t about last night&mdash;ye mid ha&rsquo;
had a chance, for Trooper Willcocks was givin&rsquo; Rosie a
turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim breathed a benediction, equally applicable to all the
parties in question, and elbowed his way to the front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s took up wi&rsquo; Rosie now, has he?&rdquo;
he <a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>inquired, &ldquo;&rsquo;twon&rsquo;t last&mdash;nay,
&rsquo;twon&rsquo;t last, sure.&nbsp; She never were fit to hold
a candle to Chrissy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosie&rsquo;s discarded young man was still sufficiently
susceptible where she was concerned to be disposed to take up the
cudgels in her defence, and was opening his mouth to make some
angry rejoinder, when he was prevented by the first speaker, who,
removing a long clay pipe from his mouth, and waving it solemnly
in the air, commanded silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this here bain&rsquo;t no
time for quarrelling.&nbsp; As we was a-sayin&rsquo; afore Jim
Hardy come in, summat must be done.&nbsp; It bain&rsquo;t only
Chrissy and Rosie&mdash;it&rsquo;s every maid in the whole
countryside.&nbsp; So soon as ever that there chap comes in
sight, in his old yaller coat and breeches, and them there
bandaged legs, and cockin&rsquo; his hat so knowin&rsquo; over
his eye, the maids goes fair silly.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen it
myself,&rdquo; he added feelingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Sam!&rdquo; cried out a voice from the rear.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What? ye don&rsquo;t mean to say as your
Mary&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind my Mary,&rdquo; interrupted Sam loftily,
&ldquo;the question&rsquo;s this.&nbsp; This here man&rsquo;s a
public noosance, and as such must be removed; now, how be we to
remove en?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>&ldquo;Parson can&rsquo;t make en shift,&rdquo;
murmured Tom dolefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low a witch &rsquo;ud not have no
power over he,&rdquo; said Jim, thinking ruefully of his
unsuccessful attempt with the bees&rsquo; wax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; it don&rsquo;t seem to answer to go
fightin&rsquo; of he, neither,&rdquo; remarked Tom, who had a
very noticeable black eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a-wonderin&rsquo;,&rdquo; pursued Sam, &ldquo;if
we couldn&rsquo;t someways ha&rsquo; the law on him.&nbsp; He mid
be run in for trespassin&rsquo; maybe, or for makin&rsquo; away
wi&rsquo; other folks&rsquo; property&mdash;meanin&rsquo; the
maids&rsquo; &rsquo;earts, do &rsquo;ee see? ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lard, what a notion!&rdquo; cried Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
the maids theirselves would take his part, sayin&rsquo; they
gived &rsquo;em to en willin&rsquo;.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s no
use.&nbsp; What I say is, Here be six on us, let&rsquo;s go at en
all together an&rsquo; duck en.&nbsp; That &rsquo;ud maybe cool
en a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A young man who had for some time been standing on the
outskirts of the group silently listening, now came forward,
throwing out his hand to command attention.&nbsp; He was a
sharp-featured youth with cunning little eyes and a sly
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon for interrupting,&rdquo; he began,
&ldquo;but if you think of callin&rsquo; in the aid of the law, I
shall be &rsquo;appy to advise ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>&ldquo;Why, &rsquo;tis the lawyer chap,&rdquo; said
Tom.&nbsp; &ldquo;He ought to know summat; he&rsquo;s been
apeggin&rsquo; away at a desk long enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Samuel Cross, who had indeed been clerk to the Branston
lawyer for two or three years, and who was occasionally not
averse to giving a little legal advice on his own account,
unknown to his principal, was hailed on the present occasion with
respectful satisfaction.&nbsp; Seating himself on a corner of the
deal table round which the group had gathered, and swinging his
little legs backwards and forwards, he surveyed the party with
twinkling eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First an&rsquo; <i>foremost</i>,&rdquo; he began,
&ldquo;your notion, Jim Hardy, must be dismissed at once.&nbsp;
Duck a man who wears the Queen&rsquo;s uniform?&nbsp; Why the
whole country would be up in arms?&nbsp; Sam&rsquo;s idea is
better, but I don&rsquo;t quite see how we could make it
&lsquo;trespass,&rsquo; nor yet &lsquo;appropriation of
property&rsquo;.&nbsp; The young ladies, as Jim truly said, the
young ladies would be against us there.&nbsp; We might do
something in the way of &lsquo;undue influence,&rsquo;
perhaps,&rdquo; meditatively, &ldquo;but the best of all would be
a &lsquo;Breach of Prom.&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried several voices, while
Tom, scratching his head, remarked, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite
take &rsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>&ldquo;Why, look &rsquo;ere, this chap&rsquo;s been
making up to six gals at the same time&mdash;or perhaps
they&rsquo;ve bin a-makin&rsquo; up to him&mdash;anyhow,
whichever way ye put it, every gal in the place is running after
him.&nbsp; Well, he can&rsquo;t possibly marry them all,
don&rsquo;t ye see?&nbsp; The thing &rsquo;ud be to induce one of
these here disapp&rsquo;inted gals to threaten to take an action
against him for Breach of Promise of Marriage.&nbsp; Nothing in
the world frightens a man so much as the notion of an action for
&lsquo;Breach&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other Sam slapped his thigh and roared with
laughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well done,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Rabbit me, it do take a lawyer to think of they
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest, however, looked dubious.&nbsp; Each one thought of
his own sweetheart, and mentally resolved that she should never
be permitted to sacrifice herself for the public weal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ees,&rdquo; said Tom hesitatingly, voicing the
general sentiment after a pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;It do sound right
enough, but the question is&mdash;which maid is it to
be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s easily answered,&rdquo; returned
Cross, waving his pipe airily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Which is the staidest
an&rsquo; ugliest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a simultaneous outcry; the maidens of Branston and
the neighbourhood <a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>were apparently each and all in the flower of youth and
beauty.&nbsp; Sharp words were exchanged, however.&nbsp; Tom,
while defending Rosie from the imputed cast in her eye, took
occasion to animadvert on Mary&rsquo;s carroty locks, and the
last-named damsel&rsquo;s admirer nearly came to blows with Jim
on the subject of Chrissy&rsquo;s age, he asserting that she was
a staid girl, while her lover stoutly declared that she was not
yet five-and-twenty.</p>
<p>Just as the hubbub was at its height, an elderly man, who had
been smoking in silent amusement in the corner of the room,
remarked that if they were on the look-out for an ill-favoured
sort o&rsquo; body, a bit on in years, they couldn&rsquo;t do
better than see what could be made of Anne Clarke of the
&ldquo;Roebuck&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seed Trooper Willcocks wi&rsquo; his arm round her
waist t&rsquo;other day,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp; &ldquo;Him
an&rsquo; a couple more young sparks come in for a
glass&mdash;and Willcocks had had a drop too much already.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;d got into the way o&rsquo; love-making, d&rsquo;ye see,
and she was the only maid handy, so he made up to her,
bein&rsquo; too far gone to see the difference.&nbsp; If he
didn&rsquo;t begin palaverin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; tellin&rsquo; her
cock-an&rsquo;-bull stories about his adventures out there at the
war, and how he longed for faymale love an&rsquo; sympathy.&nbsp;
His <a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>arm
was round her waist, I tell &rsquo;ee, before his first pint was
drunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Samuel Cross jumped off the table, his little eyes dancing in
his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;The very thing,&rdquo; he cried
rapturously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Boys, we&rsquo;ll make a grand job of
this.&nbsp; It will work up to a lovely case.&nbsp; But
Mum&rsquo;s the word, remember&mdash;the game will be spoilt if a
hint of it gets out.&nbsp; Cheer up, lovers all, you&rsquo;ll get
your sweethearts back, I promise you.&nbsp; If Trooper Willcocks
doesn&rsquo;t show a clean pair of heels before long, I&rsquo;m a
Dutchman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Roebuck Inn was a somewhat dreary-looking little hostelry,
about a mile away from the town of Branston.&nbsp; It was
situated in a kind of fold in the downs, a hollow between two
vast undulating tracts of green.&nbsp; A handful of thatched
cottages flanked it, and the river ran so near that the premises
of the Roebuck were regularly flooded once or twice a year when
&ldquo;the springs rose&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The landlord of the little tumble-down place took these
visitations very philosophically: indeed it was noticeable that
his spirits were uplifted in proportion to the rising of the
springs, knowing, as he had reason to do, that this watery rising
habitually produced elevation of another kind among his
customers.&nbsp; For <a name="page276"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>when one&rsquo;s fields are flooded
and one&rsquo;s spirits damped, one is all the better able to
appreciate an exhilarating glass, particularly when that glass is
partaken of under peculiar and mirth-producing circumstances.</p>
<p>When Billy Clarke&rsquo;s lower premises were under water, the
topers were forced to migrate upstairs to the biggest bedroom,
and there with a roaring fire in the tiny grate, packed
themselves side by side upon the ancient four-post bed, and amid
uproarious laughter devised every conceivable pretext for sending
cross-grained Anne creaking down the slippery stairs, and
clicking and sliding about on her pattens on the wet tiles
below.&nbsp; The strife between her cupidity and her ill-temper
was an endless source of amusement to her clients; Anne Clarke
would walk a mile for twopence, it was said, but she took it out
in &ldquo;language&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The dusk was gathering when Samuel Cross called upon this
damsel, and, though &ldquo;the water had been out&rdquo; a few
days before, it had now partially subsided.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;barton,&rdquo; to be sure, was still more like a lake than
a farm-yard, and Billy&rsquo;s two cows, standing knee-deep in a
dark slimy mess which once had been a manure heap of more than
respectable dimensions, looked very forlorn and wretched.&nbsp;
Anne, still <a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>clinking about on her pattens, wore a particularly
forbidding expression on her frosty face as she paused on her way
from the clothes-line, a basket of linen poised on her hip, to
return the visitor&rsquo;s salutation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tother way to the tap-room,&rdquo; she added
ungraciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Miss Clarke.&nbsp; I come on a very
different matter&mdash;a very delic<i>ate</i> matter, and one
which nearly concerns you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne fixed her most tractable eye upon him and considered;
after a few minutes a light appeared to break in on her, and her
face became almost pleasant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low ye be the lawyer feller,
bain&rsquo;t ye?&nbsp; Have &rsquo;ee come to say Father or
me&rsquo;s come in to a legacy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly that, Miss Clarke, though I shouldn&rsquo;t
say there wasn&rsquo;t money in it.&nbsp; You will find, Miss,
that it will be to your advantage to place entire confidence in
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne hitched the basket a little higher up on her hip,
assisting the operation by a jerk of her bony knee, and stared
harder than ever; even the unmanageable eye assuming an
expression of lively interest which was positively uncanny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What be to do?&rdquo; she asked breathlessly.</p>
<p><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>Samuel came closer, laid one hand on the cold, damp,
red arm which encircled the basket, and whispered
mysteriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It concerns your affections, Miss Clarke.&nbsp; Your
woman&rsquo;s &rsquo;eart, what have been cruelly trifled
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; returned Miss Clarke succinctly and
fiercely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee think ye can come
a-gammonin&rsquo; o&rsquo; me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m up to ye an&rsquo;
your tricks.&nbsp; Be off this minute, or
I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, my good lady, be patient,&rdquo; cried
Samuel, starting back, well out of reach of the basket, which the
irate damsel had lifted suspiciously high.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
come here in your interest, I assure you.&nbsp; I have come to
make a suggestion which is entirely to your advantage, and which
will not only avenge your outraged feelin&rsquo;s, but put money
in your pocket.&nbsp; But you must listen to me&mdash;you must
allow me to explain; moreover you must trust in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne hitched up her basket again and jerked her thumb in the
direction of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will &rsquo;ee come in?&rdquo; she inquired; and
without waiting for a reply led the way through the yard, over a
kind of wooden dam which had been placed across the doorway, and
finally into the damp and deserted tap-room, where <a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>an
evil-smelling paraffin lamp was already burning.&nbsp; Having set
down her burden and closed the door, she turned and faced the
lawyer&rsquo;s clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Clarke,&rdquo; began Samuel respectfully and
mysteriously, &ldquo;a rumour has reached me of the villainous
way in which Trooper Willcocks has trifled with your
feelin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Now wait a bit, now wait a
bit&mdash;&rdquo; uplifting one hand as Anne was about to make
some wrathful rejoinder.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d be quite in the
right to object to my intrudin&rsquo; on so delic<i>ate</i> a
matter if there weren&rsquo;t a <i>business</i> side to it, but
ye see there is a business side and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve
come about.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s woman&rsquo;s rights as well as
woman&rsquo;s feelin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Ah, if it wasn&rsquo;t for
that, Miss Clarke, maybe some of us gay young men would find your
sex even more <i>un</i>resistible than we do already.&nbsp; But
the notion of a Breach of Prom., Miss, is enough to steady the
liveliest of us.&rdquo;&nbsp; He leered at her out of his cunning
little eyes, and continued emphatically: &ldquo;Maybe you
didn&rsquo;t know, Miss Clarke, as when a good-for-nothing young
chap same as Trooper Willcocks comes philandering arter a lady
that lady can have the law on him if he goes too far.&nbsp; Now
there&rsquo;s a strange <a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>report in the town what says Trooper
Willcocks&rsquo; arm were round your waist t&rsquo;other night,
Miss Clarke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne squinted down sideways at the singularly unattractive
portion of her person just alluded to, as though wondering how
Trooper Willcocks&rsquo; arm had ever got there; and indeed such
a proceeding indicated an almost sublime degree of courage on the
part of the gallant yeoman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a very tender act,&rdquo; pursued Cross,
&ldquo;but a tender act don&rsquo;t count for nothin&rsquo; by
itself without the words are compromisin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Now, can
you call to mind anythin&rsquo; as Trooper Willcocks <i>said</i>,
Miss Clarke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; supposin&rsquo; I did I&rsquo;d maybe have no
fancy for repeatin&rsquo; of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; retorted the lady
with a faint increase of colour in her sallow cheeks.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;d had a drop too much, Trooper Willcocks had, and
he did give I a lot of impidence.&nbsp; <i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t
take no notice of &rsquo;em&mdash;he did make I laugh at the time
I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cross pricked up his ears.&nbsp; Anne&rsquo;s admission
denoted that the impression produced by the warrior had been even
greater than he had supposed, for she was not as a rule given to
seeing the humorous side of things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis this way, d&rsquo;ye see,&rdquo; he said, <a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>insinuatingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;If we can prove as Trooper
Willcocks went beyond a certain p&rsquo;int in his lovin&rsquo;
speeches we can take a action again him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what &rsquo;ud be the good o&rsquo;
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit, Miss, wait a bit!&rdquo; said Samuel,
sawing the air again with his lean forefinger.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
can take a action again him, as I say, what will force him either
to lead you to the altar or to pay you a substantial sum of money
as damages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A slow smile broke over Anne&rsquo;s ill-favoured face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye mean him an&rsquo; me &rsquo;ud have to get
married?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either that or, supposin&rsquo; the villain
wasn&rsquo;t willin&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; he <i>is</i> a
villain, Miss Clarke, a low deceivin&rsquo;
rascal&mdash;he&rsquo;d have to put his hand in his pocket and
<i>fork</i> out, Miss.&nbsp; Either way, d&rsquo;ye see,
you&rsquo;d be the gainer.&nbsp; But all <i>de</i>pends upon your
memory.&nbsp; Now, in confidence, Miss Clarke, in strict
confidence to a <i>h</i>onourable man, tell me, what did Trooper
Willcocks say to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He called I a beauty two or three times,&rdquo;
returned Anne, after cogitating for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Cross, &ldquo;a&mdash;a nat&rsquo;ral
remark of course, but not compromising.&nbsp; He said more than
that, I&rsquo;m sure, Miss Clarke.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>&ldquo;He said,&rdquo; she went on, knitting her brows
in the effort to recall the trooper&rsquo;s blandishments,
&ldquo;he said he wondered I&rsquo;d remained single till
now.&nbsp; The bwoys didn&rsquo;t know what they was about, he
said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more like it!&rdquo; cried Samuel,
snapping his fingers joyfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s follow up
that tack, Miss Clarke, if <i>you</i> please.&nbsp; Did he chance
to say now as <i>he</i> had better taste?&nbsp; That &rsquo;ud be
a very likely remark for him to make, ye know.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
you recollect somethin&rsquo; of that sort, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Anne, shaking her head, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t call to mind as he did.&nbsp; He said as if my eyes
was a pair there wouldn&rsquo;t be their match in the
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it you&rsquo;ve made a mistake there,
Miss,&rdquo; said Cross, leaning forward and speaking with
increased earnestness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I dessay, bein&rsquo; a bit
flurried at the time, you didn&rsquo;t take reg&rsquo;lar notice;
but that &rsquo;ud be a silly thing for any one to say.&nbsp; You
might be sure his remark really was somethin&rsquo; like this:
&lsquo;You an&rsquo; I should be a pair, Miss; I&rsquo;ve come to
make a match in the country.&rsquo;&nbsp; You see he <i>has</i>
come down to the country, and what more likely than that
he&rsquo;s come on purpose to find a wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>Anne,
fixing her interlocutor with one of the eyes alluded to in the
gallant speech she had quoted, and rubbing her hands together,
began to think it was very likely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he kissed you, I s&rsquo;pose, Miss
Clarke?&rdquo; went on the inquisitor presently.&nbsp; &ldquo;He!
he! he!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis most unfair to ax such questions,
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went for to do it once, but I did smack his face for
&rsquo;en an&rsquo; he didn&rsquo;t try no more,&rdquo; put in
Anne a trifle regretfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Twould ha&rsquo;
been better, I s&rsquo;pose, if he had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it would have been more compromising, but the
great thing to go on is what he <i>said</i>.&nbsp; Try and
remember that, Miss.&nbsp; He told you about the war an&rsquo;
how lonesome he was out there, didn&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; &lsquo;No
lovin&rsquo; faymales there,&rsquo; he said; so they tell
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E-es,&rdquo; agreed Anne.&nbsp; &ldquo;He did
say, &lsquo;Little did I think out there on the veldt as I should
so soon have my arm about a little charmer like
you&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he?&rdquo; said Cross eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E-es.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lucky wound,&rsquo; says he,
&lsquo;to give I this chance!&rsquo;&nbsp; An&rsquo; he did say
as if he were sent out again I should have to go too, for he
couldn&rsquo;t never stand the thought of sayin&rsquo; good-bye
to I.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>&ldquo;That &rsquo;ull do!&rdquo; shouted Samuel,
leaping from his chair and positively crowing with glee.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ve got him.&nbsp; He said you must go
too&mdash;meanin&rsquo;, of course, as his bride.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s enough.&nbsp; Shake hands, Miss Clarke!&nbsp; We
have got him fairly cornered now.&nbsp; Marriage or
money&mdash;one or t&rsquo;other.&nbsp; If I was you I&rsquo;d go
in for the money, Miss Clarke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne turned to him with a simper that sent a cold shiver down
his back.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure o&rsquo;
that,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord,&rdquo; muttered Cross to himself, &ldquo;I
wish she&rsquo;d smile like that at Willcocks.&nbsp; The job
&rsquo;ud be done then.&nbsp; It &rsquo;ud be enough to rout an
army.&nbsp; Well, you leave the matter in my hands,&rdquo; he
continued aloud.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pull it through,
you&rsquo;ll see.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll hear from me before long,
Miss Clarke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he took his leave, and was presently swallowed up in
the darkness without.&nbsp; As he walked he cogitated:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve half a mind to let it come to a action after
all; there really seems to be the makin&rsquo;s of it, and it
&rsquo;ud give me a lift with the guv&rsquo;nor.&nbsp; Lord, the
old gal&rsquo;s a caution.&nbsp; Trooper Willcocks &rsquo;ll
shake in his shoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grinned to himself at the recollection of Anne&rsquo;s
face, and mimicked her last speech <a name="page285"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 285</span>aloud: &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not
so sure o&rsquo; that&rsquo;.&nbsp; He! he! . . .&nbsp; It
&rsquo;ud be the best joke ever known in Branston if it did come
off, and the guv&rsquo;nor &rsquo;d make the most of it.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s uncommon tightfisted, the guv&rsquo;nor is,
though&rdquo;&mdash;here his face clouded over&mdash;&ldquo;none
of the profits &rsquo;ud come my way I don&rsquo;t think; best
see what can be made out o&rsquo; the other chaps,
p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps.&nbsp; Come, we&rsquo;ll work it some
way.&nbsp; Blest if I&rsquo;m going to have my long walk
an&rsquo; my long talk for nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A very anxious little group gathered round Mr. Cross when he
entered the bar of the Three Choughs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; cried Jim Hardy breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; echoed Cross, wagging his head, &ldquo;I
think we&rsquo;ve got our gentleman in a tight place, jest
about!&nbsp; There he&rsquo;ve been triflin&rsquo; with that
tender young creetur yonder at the Roebuck that shameful that
she&rsquo;s determined to bring him to book.&nbsp; Called her his
little charmer, he did&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here there was a roar of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And invited her to go back to South Africa with
him,&rdquo; resumed Samuel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s got a
good case, no doubt o&rsquo; that.&nbsp; But the question is, how
far any o&rsquo; you &rsquo;ull be the better for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Jim, while the other <a
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>love-sick
swains nudged each other, and murmured indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I think she&rsquo;s fair bent on taking out that
action,&rdquo; responded their legal adviser, &ldquo;and that
o&rsquo; course will keep him in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Poor
chap, it &rsquo;ull take your young ladies all their time to
console him, I should think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The listeners stared at him in blank dismay; he wagged his
head again, very knowingly, and crossed one leg over the
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he repeated reflectively,
&ldquo;Anne Clarke has got about as good a case as ever I heard
on, and I advised her to follow it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You advised her,&rdquo; shouted Tom indignantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come, that&rsquo;s a pretty thing.&nbsp; I thought you was
on our side, Sam&rsquo;el Cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lawyer,&rdquo; returned Samuel sententiously,
&ldquo;a lawyer is on the side what pays best; an&rsquo; this
here job ought to be good for a rise for me.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill
be but fair that I should share some of the governor&rsquo;s
pickings, and he&rsquo;ll make a good thing out of it, you might
be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; said one of the
lovers dolefully.&nbsp; &ldquo;He be uncommon near, your boss be,
and it do seem &rsquo;ard o&rsquo; you, Sam&rsquo;el, to go
a-desertin&rsquo; of we, arter leadin&rsquo; us on, so to
speak.&nbsp; You could stop Anne Clarke from takin&rsquo; out <a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>this here
summons or whatever it be, so soon as look at her, couldn&rsquo;t
&rsquo;ee now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dessay I could,&rdquo; said Cross calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you was to go and threaten Willcocks with the
notion of it, he&rsquo;d be off like a shot, that&rsquo;s easy
seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So &rsquo;tis,&rdquo; agreed the clerk.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
reckon he&rsquo;d skip if I was to tell him all that his little
charmer said to-day.&nbsp; He!&nbsp; He!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Jim, and
paused&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s how it is,&rdquo; he added
lamely.&nbsp; &ldquo;The job &rsquo;ud be easy done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jus&rsquo; so,&rdquo; responded Cross.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
easiest thing in the world.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m not for
undertaking no jobs as are not worth my while.&nbsp; Now I might
get rid o&rsquo; Trooper Willcocks for a five-pun&rsquo; note,
not less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pause of consternation ensued; then Jim Hardy thumped the
table with his fist.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think it &rsquo;ud be easier
and cheaper to break the feller&rsquo;s boanes straight
off,&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>Sam extended a forefinger in his direction, &ldquo;You look
out, Jim!&nbsp; You should know better nor say such things in the
hearin&rsquo; o&rsquo; them whose dooty it is to uphold the
law.&nbsp; If any harm comes to Trooper Willcocks, I shall be
bound in conscience to give my evidence.&nbsp; Now, gentlemen,
what be all looking so glum <a name="page288"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 288</span>for?&nbsp; Five pound ain&rsquo;t
such a terror!&nbsp; It needn&rsquo;t be paid in a note if it
comes to that, nor all at the one time.&nbsp; Half within the
week, say, an&rsquo; t&rsquo;other half at the end o&rsquo; the
month.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t be hard with you, an&rsquo; Trooper
Willcocks would certainly be a good riddance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They gathered round him again and after much argument, some
laughter, and a good deal of swearing, came to terms with Samuel,
who carried away with him that night a curious document, signed
by half a dozen names, and drawn up entirely to his own
satisfaction.</p>
<p>Trooper Willcocks was swaggering about just outside the church
door on the following Sunday, when he was accosted by Samuel
Cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was looking for you,&rdquo; began the latter, drawing
him aside.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have a word or two to say to you, Mr.
Willcocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t another day do?&rdquo; returned the
yeoman.&nbsp; &ldquo;The service will be over in a few minutes,
and I&rsquo;m waitin&rsquo; for a young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Indeed</i>,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;might I make so
bold as to inquire if the lady&rsquo;s name is Miss Anne
Clarke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anne Clarke,&rdquo; repeated the trooper vacantly; the
name awakened no response in his memory.</p>
<p><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
289</span>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you know,&rdquo; cried Sam,
&ldquo;your <i>little charmer</i> of the Roebuck Inn&mdash;a
regular <i>beauty</i>, Mr. Willcocks.&nbsp; <i>Your</i> beauty,
you know.&nbsp; Why I understood you was a-going to take her to
South Africa wi&rsquo; you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil are you at?&rdquo; cried Willcocks
irritably.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean by talking all that
rubbish to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Sam, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not to be put off like that, Trooper Willcocks.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
here on behalf of that very lady&mdash;if the matter can be
settled private, so much the better; if not, she&rsquo;s
determined to take it into court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden pallor overspread the yeoman&rsquo;s visage,
perceptible even beneath its tan; he was a soft young fellow in
spite of all his daring, and the very name of the law-courts
terrified him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said Cross jovially, &ldquo;you
haven&rsquo;t no very clear rec&rsquo;lection of it, I
dessay&mdash;you&rsquo;re such a one with the ladies aren&rsquo;t
you?&nbsp; But sometimes a chap goes too far&mdash;an&rsquo; when
it comes to making a reg&rsquo;lar proposal of
marriage&mdash;you&rsquo;ll find you&rsquo;ll have to stick to
it, or else be let in for more than you bargained for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But really,&rdquo; said the other, almost piteously,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no notion at all o&rsquo; what you&rsquo;re
drivin&rsquo; at.&nbsp; <a name="page290"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>Who is Anne Clarke, an&rsquo; where
did I meet her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam drew nearer and button-holed him confidentially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the Roebuck Inn, over the downs yonder?&nbsp;
You went there last Toosday with one or two
friends&mdash;an&rsquo; you carried on fearful with the old
man&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;a beauty, I tell ye.&nbsp; You was a
bit on at the time, but you must remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember goin&rsquo; there,&rdquo; admitted
Willcocks, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t call to mind no young
gal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pity,&rdquo; returned Sam.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She knows all about you, I can tell you, and she have it
settled in her own mind to consult our guv&rsquo;nor to-morrow,
without you come to some amicable arrangement first.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Money or Matrimony,&rsquo; says she.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matrimony?&rdquo; ejaculated Willcocks, his jaw
dropping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-es, matrimony,&rdquo; repeated Sam, darting a
sidelong glance at his victim, and meditatively scratching his
jaw.&nbsp; &ldquo;I rather think the lady&rsquo;s fancy is set
that way.&nbsp; You should ha&rsquo; seen her smile when we
talked on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the name of fortun&rsquo; am I to do?&rdquo;
inquired the yeoman, with a helpless glance; <a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>a mouse
might as profitably have appealed to the cat in whose claws it
found itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The folks are comin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; church
now,&rdquo; cried Cross eagerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just you step in
under this here archway, Trooper, an&rsquo; look out cautious,
but keep out o&rsquo; sight yourself.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder if Miss Clarke was here&mdash;I&rsquo;ll p&rsquo;int her
out to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The distracted yeoman obeyed, and presently a stream of people
issued from the porch on the opposite side of the road, breaking
up for the most part into little knots of twos and threes, though
a few figures made their way homewards unescorted.&nbsp; While
anxiously on the look out for the mysterious damsel of the
Roebuck, Trooper Willcocks witnessed one or two little episodes
which filled him with rage and mortification.&nbsp; Pretty
Chrissy Baverstock, for instance, after loitering on the steps
for quite five minutes, craning a slender neck and tossing her
fair curls, was accosted by a bluff-looking labouring fellow, Jim
Hardy in fact, who, after a few minutes&rsquo; parley, drew her
arm through his, and walked away with her.&nbsp; Rosy-cheeked
Mary Miles went through the same preliminary period of waiting
and head-tossing, but departed alone, her handkerchief to her
eyes.&nbsp; The over-soft heart of Trooper <a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>Willcocks
was wrung within him at the sight.</p>
<p>But now Samuel Cross recalled his wandering attention by an
admonitory dig: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s her,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>Willcocks peered cautiously out and presently drew his head
inwards with a jerk, his face as white as ashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one,&rdquo; he gasped.&nbsp; &ldquo;That old,
skinny, squinting&mdash;good Lord, surely I never said anything
in the way o&rsquo; sweetheartin&rsquo; to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You only axed her to marry you&mdash;before
witnesses,&rdquo; returned the implacable Samuel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way out of it, man.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll
have the law on you without you lead her to the altar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was awful far gone on Toosday night I
remember,&rdquo; groaned the luckless yeoman, wiping a clammy
brow.&nbsp; &ldquo;But a man shouldn&rsquo;t be held accountable
for what he says when he&rsquo;s that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo; bless you,&rdquo; returned Cross cheerfully,
&ldquo;the law don&rsquo;t take no account of such excuses.&nbsp;
You weren&rsquo;t incapable, you see; you was able to walk about,
an&rsquo; put your arm round her waist an&rsquo; that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! I must ha&rsquo; been far gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that.&nbsp; Says you,
&lsquo;My beauty,&rsquo; says you, &lsquo;my little charmer, you
an&rsquo; <a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>me must be a pair,&rsquo; says you; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
come to the country to look for my match,&rsquo; says
you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have said that,&rdquo; interrupted
Willcocks.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t true to begin
with.&nbsp; I am going out to the front in a few
weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; commented Sam, &ldquo;you told her that,
an&rsquo; you asked her to go back with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But hang it, man, the thing&rsquo;s
impossible&mdash;ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ridiculous!&nbsp; I should just think it was.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll be the laughin&rsquo;-stock of the
countryside!&nbsp; What will Chrissy Baverstock
say&mdash;an&rsquo; Mary an&rsquo; Rosie, an&rsquo; the rest of
them, and all their fellows when it comes out in court?&nbsp; And
it certainly will, without you marry her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord,&rdquo; cried poor Willcocks, now quite
unnerved, &ldquo;is there no way out of it?&nbsp; Look here, I
know you&rsquo;re a good chap&mdash;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d make it
worth your while.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got a few pounds.&nbsp;
Couldn&rsquo;t you just&mdash;just hush it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam pursed up his mouth into whistling form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be done&mdash;but it&rsquo;s a bit
dangerous,&rdquo; he said dubiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;If my governor
was to get on the scent&mdash;but there, I&rsquo;ll try and keep
him off it, and if you&rsquo;ll hand over them few pounds, I
dessay I could stop old Anne Clarke&rsquo;s mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>&ldquo;And what&mdash;what must I do?&rdquo; queried
the trooper, his teeth chattering in his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut,&rdquo; said Sam briefly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cut off
home, an&rsquo; never let yourself be seen in this part of the
country again&mdash;else as sure as I&rsquo;m alive, Anne Clarke
will have you!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>There was jubilee and surprise in Branston on the following
day when it became known, through the medium of Mr. Samuel Cross,
that Trooper Willcocks had flown; and many were the surmises
among the uninitiated as to the cause of his sudden
departure.&nbsp; Some opined that he had been ordered again to
the front, others that he was engaged to a young lady at
Capetown.&nbsp; Anne Clarke became a trifle more sour as to face,
and short as to temper than before, but whatever means the
lawyer&rsquo;s clerk employed for stopping her mouth, it is
certain that Trooper Willcocks&rsquo; few pounds never found
their way to her pocket.</p>
<h2><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>HOW
GRANFER VOLUNTEERED.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Farmer</span> Sampson rolled slowly
homewards after church one wintry Sunday, full of a comfortable
sense of righteousness, and looking forward to a reposeful hour
before the midday meal.&nbsp; He exchanged greetings with his
neighbours, discussed with them the probability of
&ldquo;snow-stuff&rdquo; coming, or the likelihood of &ldquo;its
taking up&rdquo; that night.&nbsp; Being an affable man his
opinion invariably coincided with that of the last person who
spoke to him.</p>
<p>Arrived at his own substantial dwelling and pausing a moment
on passing through the kitchen to inhale the fragrance of the
roasting joint, he proceeded first to the best parlour&mdash;an
awe-inspiring room, never used save for a christening or a
funeral; a shrine for stuffed birds, wax fruits and flowers,
unopened books, and the family&rsquo;s best wearing
apparel.&nbsp; Mrs. Sampson&rsquo;s Sunday bonnet reposed in the
bandbox beneath the sofa; the accompanying gown <a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>was stowed
away on one of the shelves of the bureau; other garments
belonging respectively to children and grandchildren were hidden
beneath silver paper in various receptacles; and the master of
the house, now divesting himself of his broad-cloth coat, hung it
carefully on the back of a chair, and restored his hat to the peg
allotted to it behind the door.&nbsp; Then, making his way to the
family living-room, he assumed his white pinner&mdash;a clean
one, which had been laid ready for him on the table&mdash;took up
the newspaper, sat down in the wide arm-chair by the hearth which
his substantial figure filled to a nicety, drew his spectacles
from his pocket and began to read.</p>
<p>As he slowly spelt out line after line, his forefinger moving
along the column in pace with his eyes, the air of contentment
with which he had at first settled to his task gave way, first to
an expression of puzzled astonishment, then to one of
irresolution, and finally to absolute consternation.&nbsp; After,
however, reading and re-reading the paragraph which had attracted
his attention in the weekly sheet, scratching his head, rubbing
his nose, drumming with his fingers on the table, and in fact
availing himself to the full of every recognised aid to thought,
his brow cleared, and bringing <a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>one mighty clenched hand down on the
open palm of the other, he exclaimed aloud:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m blest if I
don&rsquo;t do it&mdash;my dooty do stare me in the
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, wheeling round slowly in his chair so as to face
the door&mdash;a matter of some little difficulty&mdash;he
proceeded to call, or rather to bellow at the top of his
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Missus!&nbsp; Grandma!&nbsp; Come here, will
&rsquo;ee?&nbsp; Polly, Annie&mdash;be there any one about?&nbsp;
Here little uns&mdash;go an&rsquo; fetch Grandma, one on
you.&nbsp; Mis&mdash;sus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently there was a rush of feet, and Mrs. Sampson entered,
followed by her married daughter, Polly, with three or four
children clinging to her skirts, while Maidy Annie, the
father&rsquo;s favourite, hastened in from the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me, Granfer! whatever be the matter?&rdquo;
enquired his wife anxiously.</p>
<p>Good old Sampson had been known as &ldquo;Father&rdquo; in the
family circle for many a year, until Polly and her husband had
taken up their abode at the farm, when the title of
&ldquo;Granfer,&rdquo; naturally used by the children, had come
to be universally adopted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There be matter enough for one while,&rdquo; he now
responded gloomily, and yet with a certain air of dignified
triumph.</p>
<p><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>&ldquo;Dear heart alive, they Boers bain&rsquo;t
a-comin&rsquo; to fight us over here, be they?&rdquo; cried
Annie, who was an imaginative young person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no knowin&rsquo; what they&rsquo;ll be
a-thinkin&rsquo; on if we don&rsquo;t look out,&rdquo; responded
her father importantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It bain&rsquo;t so much the
Boers,&rdquo; he continued, with a superior air,
&ldquo;&rsquo;tis the French as we must be on our guard
against&mdash;an&rsquo; the Germans&mdash;and the
Roosians!&rdquo; he cried emphatically, his eyes growing wider
and wider as he named each nationality.&nbsp; &ldquo;They do say
that they do all hate us worse nor p&rsquo;ison, an&rsquo; is
only lookin&rsquo; for an opportunity for attackin&rsquo;
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear, you don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; groaned Mrs.
Sampson.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis worse nor in Boney&rsquo;s
time.&nbsp; Lard! I can mind my father tellin&rsquo; me as when
he was a boy they was expectin&rsquo; for sure as Boney &rsquo;ud
land, and the country very near went mad wi&rsquo; fright.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; now ye say there be more nor the French agen
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ever is to be done,&rdquo; put in Polly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think as there can be many soldiers a-left
i&rsquo; the country wi&rsquo; them great ships full goin&rsquo;
out week after week.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s to defend us if any
o&rsquo; them folks from abroad do come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Granfer looked slowly round from one anxious face to the
other, rolled his head from <a name="page299"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 299</span>side to side, heaved a deep sigh,
and finally remarked in a sepulchral tone:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s summat goin&rsquo; to be done, ye mid be
sure.&rdquo;&nbsp; He paused, nodded, smoothed out the paper on
his knee, and finally handed it with a tragic air to Annie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;See, here, my maid,&rdquo; he said, indicating a certain
paragraph with his broad thumb, &ldquo;read this here to your
mother an&rsquo; all on us.&nbsp; Then ye&rsquo;ll see
what&rsquo;s a-goin&rsquo; to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw himself back in his chair, while Annie, somewhat
mystified and a good deal alarmed, read the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Her Majesty the Queen has been graciously
pleased to invite her old soldiers to return to service again for
one year, in defence of the country during the absence of her
armies in South Africa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The text of the proclamation posted at the War Office
will be found in another column.&nbsp; Such an appeal will be
warmly responded to by many a loyal British heart; our veterans
will rejoice at the opportunity thus afforded them of proving
their devotion to Queen and Country.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sampson in a relieved tone,
&ldquo;think o&rsquo; that now!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure there be a
good few old soldiers about, an&rsquo; it &rsquo;ull be very nice
for &rsquo;em to get a chance o&rsquo; doin&rsquo;
summat.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>&ldquo;Very nice!&rdquo; shouted her lord, with
unaccountable fierceness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very nice, do you
say?&nbsp; That be your notion, be it?&nbsp; Well, I did look for
a bit more feelin&rsquo; from you.&nbsp; A man may be
willin&rsquo; to do his dooty, an&rsquo; yet he mid find it
oncommon hard work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Granter, what be talkin&rsquo; about?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure I never&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose, Missus, as us old folks won&rsquo;t
find it a bit agen us to go shootin&rsquo;, an&rsquo;
drillin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; man<i>o</i>verin&rsquo; an&rsquo; sich
like, at our time o&rsquo; life?&nbsp; Wi&rsquo; the best heart
in the world I reckon we be like to find it a bit
stiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me, Sampson, don&rsquo;t tell I as
<i>you&rsquo;ve</i> a-got a notion o&rsquo; j&rsquo;inin&rsquo;
the army at your time o&rsquo; life.&nbsp; Lard save us!&rdquo;
she continued with gathering irritation, &ldquo;I do believe
you&rsquo;ve a-took leave o&rsquo; your senses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear woman,&rdquo; returned the farmer, &ldquo;I
d&rsquo; &rsquo;low it will have gived ye a bit of a turn, but
there, &rsquo;tis wrote plain for all to read.&nbsp; &lsquo;Her
Majesty the Queen have invited her <i>old</i> soldiers to
serve&rsquo;&mdash;if Her Majesty have a-made up her mind as
&rsquo;tis <i>old</i> soldiers she wants, it bain&rsquo;t for the
likes of us to go agen it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve al&rsquo;ays heard
tell as the Queen were an oncommon sensible woman, an&rsquo;
she&rsquo;ve a-found out, most like, as these here youngsters
bain&rsquo;t <a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
301</span>to be trusted&mdash;ye can&rsquo;t expect old heads on
young shoulders&mdash;I never did hold wi&rsquo; them there
notions o&rsquo; shart service, an&rsquo; havin&rsquo;
nothin&rsquo; but lads in the army, an&rsquo; Her Majesty,
d&rsquo;ye see, Her Majesty do very like agree wi&rsquo;
I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but Granfer,&rdquo; said Polly doubtfully,
&ldquo;d&rsquo;ye think the Queen did mean soldiers as
had&mdash;as had left off practising so long as you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; besides,&rdquo; put in Annie quickly,
&ldquo;&rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t same as if you was ever a regular
soldier in barracks an&rsquo; that.&nbsp; Ye did only go out
wi&rsquo; the Yeomanry, didn&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned her father, indignantly,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; will &rsquo;ee go for to tell I as a man as was
twenty year a trooper in the Darset Yeomanry bain&rsquo;t a
soldier?&nbsp; Why, what else be he then?&nbsp; Ye be a voolish
maid, my dear, very voolish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo; gasped poor Mrs. Sampson, recovering
her breath at last, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis thirty year an&rsquo; more,
I&rsquo;m sure, since ye did go out wi&rsquo; &rsquo;em!&nbsp;
Ah! I&rsquo;m sure &rsquo;tis thirty year&mdash;&rsquo;twas when
poor Harry was a baby as ye did give up, &rsquo;an long afore
Polly was born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I tell &rsquo;ee what, Missus, this here kind
o&rsquo; talk isn&rsquo;t the talk for them as loves Queen
an&rsquo; Country.&nbsp; What do the papers say?&nbsp; Read <a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>for
yourself an&rsquo; see.&nbsp; If every old soldier in the country
was to go makin&rsquo; excuses, an&rsquo; thinkin&rsquo; this,
that, an&rsquo; t&rsquo;other, who&rsquo;s to defend
England?&nbsp; Now, I&rsquo;m a old man, an&rsquo; a bit stiff in
the j&rsquo;ints, an&rsquo; a bit heavy on my legs, but I can get
on a harse, and pull a trigger yet.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not
the man to go and disapp&rsquo;int the Queen!&nbsp; There, my
mind be made up, an&rsquo; ye may tark till midnight wi&rsquo;out
changin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to be sure,&rdquo; said poor Grandma, dropping
into a chair, &ldquo;I must say as I didn&rsquo;t think as I
should live to see this day.&nbsp; When a body comes to your time
o&rsquo; life I didn&rsquo;t look for ye to be tarkin&rsquo;
o&rsquo; goin&rsquo; off to the war, jist at our busiest time
o&rsquo; year, too, when we may be lookin&rsquo; out for new
calves any day, an&rsquo; the lambin&rsquo; season not half
over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a bit a&rsquo;k&rsquo;ard that, I must
agree,&rdquo; returned Sampson, his face falling as he
spoke.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, I could ha&rsquo; wished as Her Majesty
hadn&rsquo;t a-called upon us in the midst o&rsquo; lambin&rsquo;
time.&nbsp; We must do the best we can, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp;
Tom must see to things.&nbsp; I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low other folks
find it jist so hard to leave their business.&nbsp; But when ye
come to tarkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; my years, Missus, you do make a
mistake.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis my years as makes my services
valuable.&nbsp; Now, Annie, read what&rsquo;s wrote here about
the men comin&rsquo; up.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>Annie
dolorously found the place, and read how already the response
throughout the country had been unanimous, and how men were
turning up by hundreds at various military depots to offer their
services.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; commented Granfer, reflectively;
&ldquo;&lsquo;the nearest military deepotts&rsquo;&mdash;let me
see, ours &rsquo;ud be Blanchester, I suppose.&nbsp; Well,
Missus, make up your mind to it, I&rsquo;ll be off
to-morrow.&nbsp; When a thing must be done, it must be
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sampson threw her apron over her head, and began to weep;
Polly sniffed ominously, the children wailed, and Annie, flinging
her arms round her father&rsquo;s neck besought him to think
better of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, to be sure! what a fuss ye do make,&rdquo; cried
he, struggling in her embrace.&nbsp; &ldquo;What be all in such a
stew about, eh?&nbsp; I bain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; off to fight
the Boers, I tell &rsquo;ee&mdash;I be a-goin&rsquo; for to bide
here and defend the country if the French or the Roosians comes
this way.&nbsp; As like as not I shall be able to come backwards
and for&rsquo;ards pretty often to see how ye be all
a-gettin&rsquo; on.&nbsp; There, I tell &rsquo;ee, ye should take
more thought for I, an&rsquo; not go a-upsettin&rsquo; of I this
way.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis &rsquo;ard enough as &rsquo;tis!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here the large face, which was looking <a
name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
304</span>disconsolately over Annie&rsquo;s shoulder, assumed a
purple hue, and big tears gathered in Granfer&rsquo;s usually
merry eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he added weakly, as freeing one hand from
his daughter&rsquo;s somewhat strangulating caresses, he produced
a large red and yellow handkerchief, and proceeded to mop his
eyes, &ldquo;you did ought to help I instead of hinderin&rsquo;
of I!&nbsp; You do all owe a dooty to Queen and Country
yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this appeal to the better feelings of the family all
opposition was withdrawn, and presently they fell to discussing
arrangements for the carrying out his Spartan intent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My uniform is laid by safe enough, I know,&rdquo; said
Granfer; &ldquo;but &rsquo;tis a question whether &rsquo;twill
fit me or no&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got a bit stoutish since I left off
wearing of en.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lard, man! the jacket &rsquo;ll not come within a yard
o&rsquo; meetin&rsquo;&mdash;ye be twice so big round as ye did
use to be; an&rsquo; as for the trousers!&nbsp; There,
there&rsquo;s no use thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; them!&nbsp;
They&rsquo;d no more fit &rsquo;ee nor they would little Jackie
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them trousers as ye&rsquo;ve a-got on &rsquo;ud do very
well, though,&rdquo; said Polly.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re dark,
d&rsquo;ye see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to ride,&rdquo; said her father <a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
305</span>thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Ees, bein&rsquo; in
the Yeomanry, d&rsquo;ye see, I&rsquo;m bound to ride.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t look no-ways respectful like if I
didn&rsquo;t offer myself harse an&rsquo; all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what harse
ye&rsquo;ll take, wi&rsquo;out it&rsquo;s Chrissy,&rdquo;
returned Mrs. Sampson.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll never get a
saddle to stay on Vi&rsquo;let or Duke&mdash;besides
they&rsquo;re wanted for ploughin&rsquo;.&nbsp; An&rsquo; Bob
&rsquo;ud never carry ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Chrissy &rsquo;ud do, right enough.&nbsp; He was
a fine mare in his day&mdash;I never see a better&mdash;there
isn&rsquo;t a colt as I&rsquo;ve a-had from en as haven&rsquo;t
turned out well.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ees, Tom mid drive en up from the
lower mead to-morrow morn, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll rub en down a
bit and make en smart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ye&rsquo;ll never go for to ride all the way,
Granfer?&rdquo; pleaded the anxious wife.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll be joggled to pieces, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m sure
your best trousers won&rsquo;t be fit to be seen.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s reason in all things.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;d best go in
Joyce&rsquo;s cart, an&rsquo; tie Chrissy at back till ye get
near the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I mid do that,&rdquo; he agreed, with unexpected
docility.&nbsp; &ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;d find it a stiffish job
to ride so far without I had a bit more practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The discussion was here interrupted by the entrance of Tom,
Polly&rsquo;s husband; but was <a name="page306"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 306</span>resumed with even greater energy
after the state of affairs had been explained to him.&nbsp; As he
was short-sighted enough to express doubt and disapproval, the
entire family fell upon him with one accord, and reduced him to a
state of sulky submission, his mother-in-law ending the
controversy by announcing that if he had a bit of proper
feelin&rsquo; he&rsquo;d offer to go in Granfer&rsquo;s
place.</p>
<p>Long before dawn on the morrow the household was astir: Tom
plodding over the rimy fields in the wake of Chrissy; Grandma
hunting up the uniform; Polly turning over her belongings in
search of a red felt petticoat which, she declared, matched it so
well in colour and texture that portions of it might be used to
widen the tunic; and Annie arming herself with scissors, needles,
and thread in order to carry out the necessary alterations.&nbsp;
Round the kitchen fire they all presently gathered, eagerly
assisting Granfer to &ldquo;try on,&rdquo; every one talking at
once, and everyone sneezing, for Grandma was too good a manager
not to have provided against the destructive moth by embalming
the uniform in quantities of camphor and pepper.</p>
<p>After almost superhuman efforts Granfer was inducted into the
tunic, his back having <a name="page307"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 307</span>somewhat the appearance of a large
red pincushion, while between the lower end of the tunic and the
top of the Sunday trousers a good deal of grey flannel shirt was
plainly visible.&nbsp; As for meeting in front, that as Mrs.
Sampson had foretold, the garment could by no means be induced to
do, until Annie had deftly contrived to insert large strips of
Polly&rsquo;s red petticoat at the sides and in the sleeves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect I shall have to get a new &rsquo;un,&rsquo;
remarked Granfer,&rdquo; endeavouring to obtain a back view of
himself, and squinting violently in the attempt.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This here coat do seem too shart behind.&nbsp; I reckon
I&rsquo;d best take off thiccy shirt.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t ought
to stick out like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off your shirt!&rdquo; screamed his wife.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That &rsquo;ud be a pretty thing to do.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;d
be gettin&rsquo; laid up wi&rsquo; lumbaguey first thing,
an&rsquo; much good ye&rsquo;d be at your soldiering then.&nbsp;
Here, I&rsquo;ll pull it down a bit, and when your sword do go on
it won&rsquo;t show much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your arms by your side, Granfer, so much as you
can,&rdquo; advised Annie, &ldquo;an&rsquo; then the patches
won&rsquo;t be seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lard, the red do suit &rsquo;ee wonderful I&rsquo;m
sure,&rdquo; groaned Polly admiringly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think the
Queen herself &rsquo;ud be pleased if she could see
ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
308</span>Granfer smiled, and then sat down to breakfast.</p>
<p>A towel had been hung out in the hedge, which was the
recognised signal to Joyce, the carrier, that he was expected to
draw up for a consignment of some kind, and presently one of the
children, running in, announced that the van was at the
gate.&nbsp; Tom led round Chrissy, a matronly animal, mild in the
eye, long in the tooth, and with a figure whose symmetry was a
thing of the past.&nbsp; Tom had, as he explained, managed to get
a good bit of grease out of her coat, though he had not had time
to trim her fetlocks, which were indeed marvellously shaggy,
while her rusty tail almost swept the ground.</p>
<p>Granfer appeared in the doorway with his weeping family
clinging to him, his sword in his hand, his cap set at a jaunty
angle on the top of his bald head, but the rest of his military
glory hidden beneath a comfortable frieze coat.</p>
<p>After explaining his project to Mr. Joyce, the carrier, who
was speechless with admiration and astonishment, the saddle was
laid inside the van, and Granfer, tearing himself from his
womenkind, climbed up beside the driver.&nbsp; And so they set
off, with poor Chrissy meekly following at the rear of the
vehicle; <a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>and the distracted family standing by the gate until
the clipper-clopper of her heavy hoofs sounded faint in the
distance.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>What was the joyful surprise of the Sampson household when,
late on that same day, Mr. Joyce&rsquo;s van was observed to
slacken as it approached their house, and, moreover, the jaded
form of the faithful Chrissy was seen to be jogging in the rear;
when, indeed, the well-known bellow of Granfer himself hailed
them from a distance of a hundred yards or so, and presently his
burly form alighted from the vehicle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he remarked, with an odd expression, in
which perplexity appeared to struggle with relief, &ldquo;I be
come back, ye see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear heart alive, Granfer.&nbsp; I be main glad!&rdquo;
ejaculated Mrs. Sampson, breathlessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lard, I
can&rsquo;t tell &rsquo;ee how glad I be!&nbsp; There, I&rsquo;ve
been a-frettin&rsquo; of myself to death very near all day; but
however did they come to let &rsquo;ee off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Granfer, after nodding farewell to
Mr. Joyce, and waiting till the van had proceeded on its way,
&ldquo;I were a bit surprised myself, but it seems I&rsquo;ve
missed the job by three months.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
310</span>&ldquo;Why, how&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Polly and
Annie together, while Grandma, with groans of gratitude, remarked
she didn&rsquo;t care how many months it was&mdash;she was only
too thankful he had missed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been turned seventy,&rdquo; went
on the farmer, his face vacillating oddly between triumph and
disappointment, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have been took on.&nbsp; But
come in an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell ye all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having been installed in his elbow-chair, having unbuttoned
his tunic, and pushed his cap to the back of his head, Granfer
began his recital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we did get near Blanchester, I did say to carrier,
&lsquo;Joyce,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;you did best let me down
here&rsquo;; so he did pull up, and I did get out saddle, and put
it on Chrissy, an&rsquo; rub so much of the dust off as I could
wi&rsquo; a handful o&rsquo; straw&mdash;but the poor beast was
awful hot, what wi&rsquo; her long coat, an&rsquo; what wi&rsquo;
joggin&rsquo; so far.&nbsp; However, up I gets, and did ride
alongside o&rsquo; Mr. Joyce till we got to the town, and then I
turned off towards barracks.&nbsp; Well, I reckon I must
ha&rsquo; been the first o&rsquo; the old soldiers o&rsquo;
Darset as axed to take service again, for every one in the place
was turnin&rsquo; to look at me, same as if I&rsquo;d been a
show.&nbsp; Ye see I&rsquo;d took off my coat, and laid it across
saddle in front of I, and they couldn&rsquo;t help but see what
&rsquo;twas I were arter.&nbsp; When I did get to barracks they
did all come gatherin&rsquo; round me, laughin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
callin&rsquo; out, an&rsquo; makin&rsquo; sich a din as you never
did hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
311</span>&ldquo;Lard, now, Granfer, what were that for?&rdquo;
inquired Mrs. Sampson indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t tell &rsquo;ee, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo;
he replied, with lofty disdain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ignorance, I
suppose.&nbsp; As I was sayin&rsquo;, I don&rsquo;t think many
old soldiers can have offered theirselves yet.&nbsp; Well, I
didn&rsquo;t take no notice, but jist axed for the
commandin&rsquo; officer, and by-and-by he come out, an&rsquo; he
looks first at I, an&rsquo; then at Chrissy, an&rsquo; then, if
ye&rsquo;ll believe me, he began to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, my good man,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;what
may <i>you</i> want?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I did see on the
paper yesterday, as the Queen was axin&rsquo; of her old soldiers
to come an&rsquo; j&rsquo;ine again, so I be a-come to offer my
services.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The impident lads around, they fair roared, but the
officer stopped laughin&rsquo;, an&rsquo;, says he, &lsquo;Well
done,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;will you dismount an&rsquo; come
wi&rsquo; me for a minute or two, an&rsquo; we can talk the
matter over?&nbsp; Your mare will stand, I think,&rsquo; says he,
very serious.</p>
<p><a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
312</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Ees,&rsquo; says I,
&lsquo;he&rsquo;ll stand right enough, if he bain&rsquo;t meddled
wi&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he told off one o&rsquo; the men to see to en,
an&rsquo; I did slip off Chrissy, an&rsquo; did walk alongside
o&rsquo; the officer in-door to a room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To begin wi&rsquo;,&rsquo; says he,
smilin&rsquo; very kind, &lsquo;what be your name, an&rsquo; what
be your employment?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;James Sampson be my name, sir,&rsquo; says
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I be a farmer, an&rsquo; lives over yonder at
Riverton, fourteen mile away.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a bit
ill-convenient for I to leave home just now&mdash;&rsquo;tis a
busy time o&rsquo; year wi&rsquo; us farmers, d&rsquo;ye see,
what wi&rsquo; its bein&rsquo; lambin&rsquo; time, an&rsquo; what
wi&rsquo; ploughin&rsquo; an&rsquo; sowin&rsquo; an&rsquo; that;
but seein&rsquo; as the Queen herself did ax us to j&rsquo;ine
again, I wouldn&rsquo;t like for to disapp&rsquo;int Her
Majesty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, quite right,&rsquo; says he very grave and
kind.&nbsp; &lsquo;An&rsquo; how long is it, Mr. Sampson, since
you were a soldier?&nbsp; Judgin&rsquo; by your uniform,&rsquo;
says he, lookin&rsquo; at it rather hard, &lsquo;it must
ha&rsquo; been some time ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;&rsquo;tis a
matter o&rsquo; thirty year since I did leave the Darset
Yeomanry.&nbsp; I went out wi&rsquo; en for fifteen
year&mdash;ah, I didn&rsquo;t miss a single
trainin&rsquo;&mdash;but when my father died, an&rsquo; I did
settle down upon the farm, <a name="page313"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 313</span>my missus were a bit agen it, so I
did give up.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sampson, whatever made you bring my name into
it?&rdquo; said Mrs. Sampson bashfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure I don&rsquo;t know whatever the gentleman can ha&rsquo;
thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t seem to put en out a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thirty years ago,&rsquo; says he,
&lsquo;an&rsquo; fifteen years before that.&nbsp; How old are you
now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told en I&rsquo;d be seventy year of age in May.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; says he, an&rsquo; then he looks at
me solemn-like for a minute, an&rsquo; then he says: &lsquo;Well,
Mr. Sampson, I admire your sperret, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve no
doubt,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;the Queen &rsquo;ud be extremely
gratified if she knew of the offer you have made.&nbsp; But there
are one or two objections&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, sir,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s
agen it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;your figure is agen
it to begin with.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I know very
well I haven&rsquo;t exactly the kind o&rsquo; figure to go
climbin&rsquo; up kopgees an&rsquo; that&mdash;I&rsquo;m not a
volunteerin&rsquo; for foreign service,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;but
I understood as the Queen was axin&rsquo; her old soldiers to
undertake the de-fence o&rsquo; the country, an&rsquo; I reckon I
could do that so well as another.&nbsp; I <a
name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 314</span>can shoot a
bit,&rsquo; says I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ye&rsquo;ll not find many crows
about my fields,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;they be too much afeared
o&rsquo; me and my gun.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well said,&rsquo; cries he, slapping me on the
shoulder.&nbsp; &lsquo;But then there&rsquo;s your age to think
about, Mr. Sampson.&nbsp; Sixty-nine, I think you
said.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sixty-nine year and nine months, sir,&rsquo;
says I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s the
difficulty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How so, sir?&rsquo; says I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Her
Majesty did say as &rsquo;twas her old soldiers as was wanted,
an&rsquo; I be a-comin&rsquo; up to my threescore and ten,
sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; he says again, and looks at me very
solemn &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that won&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; Now
I&rsquo;ll tell you what you&rsquo;ll do, Mr. Sampson.&nbsp; Just
you go quietly home again, and wait till you&rsquo;re called
upon.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m much obliged,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;for
your handsome offer; you&rsquo;re a plucky fellow,&rsquo; he
says, and he shakes me by the hand, &lsquo;an&rsquo; if we find
we can&rsquo;t get on without you, you may be sure we will send
for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he comes wi&rsquo; me to the door, an&rsquo; the
ill-mannered folk as was standin&rsquo; there did begin
a-laughin&rsquo; again so soon as they ketched sight o&rsquo; me,
but the officer threw up his hand and stopped &rsquo;em.</p>
<p><a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
315</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Men,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
goin&rsquo; to call upon you to give three cheers for this fine
old Briton!&rsquo;&mdash;them was the very words he said, I do
assure you&mdash;&rsquo;this fine old Briton,&rsquo; says
he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he now?&nbsp; Well, that was right down
handsome,&rdquo; cried Annie and Polly together, while Grandma,
overcome with emotion, fairly wept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ees, I d&rsquo; &rsquo;low I thought it kind of
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Three cheers for this fine old Briton,&rsquo;
says he.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s made of the right stuff.&nbsp;
He has come here at great personal inconvenience to offer his
services to Queen and Country, and I say we may be proud to think
there are such men among us.&nbsp; Come, lads, a hearty
cheer.&nbsp; Hip, hip, hip&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d managed to get up on Chrissy by this
time, an&rsquo; they all run round me, cheerin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
wavin&rsquo; their caps, and I saluted &rsquo;em back,
pleasant-like, and Chrissy and me walked off so proud as
Punch.&nbsp; So, though they didn&rsquo;t take us on, ye see
we&rsquo;ve had what we mid call a good day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ees, indeed, Granfer,&rdquo; returned his
missus, delighted, but tearful still.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
we may all feel proud.&nbsp; And I am but too thankful as they
didn&rsquo;t take ye on.&nbsp; Dear heart <a
name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 316</span>alive!
&rsquo;twas a narrow escape&mdash;ye&rsquo;ll be seventy in next
to no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; agreed Granfer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a thing I didn&rsquo;t ever think on, but
&rsquo;tis plain to be seen the reason why they didn&rsquo;t take
I.&nbsp; They did ax for old soldiers and I weren&rsquo;t old
<i>enough</i>.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
